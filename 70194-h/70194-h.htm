</div>
<hr class="r5">

<p>The development of the gasoline automobile
at home and abroad has produced a great
variety of designs, good, bad, and indifferent,
but the advancement of the industry has
weeded out the unsatisfactory and improved
the good until with few exceptions the leading
makes show a striking similarity in all but
details. The advantages of certain forms of
construction have been recognized, and their
adoption by the large majority of makers has
produced what may be called a standard
type.</p>

<p>The object of this book is to explain the
principles that underlie automobile construction
and operation, and to illustrate the movements
and mechanical combinations adopted
in present-day practice. It is not the intention
to explain the exact details of construction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
of the different cars, and the illustrations
have been prepared with the sole object of
making the principles clear, for with an understanding
of these there should be no difficulty
in comprehending any particular application of
them.</p>

<p>The lubrication table on pages 244 and 245,
which was prepared by Mr. T. D. Hanauer, is
reproduced through the courtesy of the <cite>Scientific
American</cite>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The advantages of magneto ignition for internal
combustion engines are so obvious that
designers and inventors have directed their
attention to the perfection of apparatus that
will improve present methods. The number of
systems proposed for the purpose is very large
in comparison with the number in actual and
practical use, and as in a work of this size it
would be impossible to describe the many
methods for the application of the magneto
that are on the market, attention has been
given only to those that are in actual, everyday
use. The absence of a practical treatise
on the principles, application, and care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
of low and high tension magnetos is the reason
for the addition of the appendix to this
work.</p>

<span class="fs80">GASOLINE ENGINE PRINCIPLES</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">The action of a steam, gasoline, or hot-air
engine depends on the principle that
when air or other gas is heated it
expands, and that if it is confined in a space
that will not permit it to expand, in striving
to do so it creates pressure against all parts
of the chamber in which it is contained. The
more a gas is heated, the more it will expand
if it is free to do so, and if not free, the greater
will be the pressure that it will exert in striving
to expand. Pressure may thus be generated
by heat, and following along similar lines,
heat may be produced by pressure, for when the
pressure of a gas is increased by compressing
it, or forcing it to occupy a smaller space, the
gas will become heated. The reverse is also
true, that when a gas is cooled, its volume is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
reduced, which reduces the pressure that it
exerts; similarly, reducing the pressure by permitting
the gas to expand reduces its temperature.</p>

<p>To state these principles in another form, to
create pressure in a gas it must either be heated
or compressed into a smaller space, and to
reduce its pressure it must either be cooled or
permitted to expand.</p>

<p>The action of a locomotive, the most familiar
type of steam engine, is no mystery, and the
production of steam in the boiler, its passage
to the cylinder, and the application of its steady
pressure against first one side of the piston and
then the other, resulting in the turning of the
driving wheels, are well understood. Water
being converted into steam in the boiler, pressure
is created because of the tendency of the
steam to expand, but the only place in which it
may expand is the cylinder, where in so doing
it moves the piston.</p>

</div>

<p>A gasoline engine is similar to a steam engine
in that its piston is moved by the pressure
exerted by a heated and expanding gas; it is
different in that the pressure is produced inside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>of the cylinder by the combustion of an inflammable
mixture of gasoline vapor, instead of
being generated in a boiler away from the
cylinder. The heat of the combustion creates
great pressure, and as the piston is the only
part that can give before it, it is moved from
one end of the cylinder to the other, this motion
being utilized in the turning of the crank shaft.
The combustion, which is so rapid that the
generally accepted term for it is explosion, can
occur only after the mixture has been drawn
into the cylinder, and so prepared that it ignites
quickly and burns completely, with the
object of obtaining the greatest possible heat
from it in the shortest possible time. In order
that one explosion may be followed by another,
the burned and useless products of combustion
must be expelled to make place for a fresh charge
of the inflammable mixture.</p>

<p>These successive events, forming a <b>cycle</b>,
must be performed as long as the engine runs,
and the constantly changing pressure in the
cylinder due to the movement of the piston
allows a fresh charge to enter, prepares it, and
expels the products of combustion after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
pressure that they have exerted has been
utilized.</p>

<p>While in the great majority of steam engines
the steam acts first on one side of the piston
and then on the other, in an automobile gasoline
engine the pressure is exerted on only one
side, the combustion of the mixture taking
place between the piston and the closed end,
or <b>head</b>, of the cylinder. The other end of the
cylinder is open, and the piston slides between
the ends, its movement from one end to the
other, called a <b>stroke</b>, corresponding to a half
revolution of the crank shaft.</p>

<p>Gasoline engines are divided into two classes,
according to the number of strokes of the
piston that are necessary to accomplish the
cycle; in the most usual type, four strokes are
necessary, the class being called the four-stroke-cycle,
or <b>four-cycle</b>, in distinction to
the two-stroke-cycle, or <b>two-cycle</b>, in which
but two strokes are necessary.</p>

<p>Of the five events that compose the cycle, three
(the <b>inlet</b>, during which the fresh mixture enters
the cylinder, its <b>compression</b> or preparation,
and the <b>exhaust</b> of the burned gases) are performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
by the piston; during the <b>power</b> event
the piston is moved by the pressure resulting
from the combustion, while the <b>combustion</b>
event is due to an outside source. In the
four-cycle type of engine, which is in almost
universal use for automobiles, the events are
considered with reference to the movement
made by the piston during which they are
performed, and may be called the <b>inlet</b>, <b>compression-combustion</b>,
<b>power</b>, and <b>exhaust strokes</b>.
In order that the engine may continue to run,
it is obvious that the events must be performed
in the correct order, and that the failure of one
will affect all the others.</p>

<p>During the inlet stroke, a charge of fresh
mixture enters the cylinder as the piston makes
an outward stroke from the closed toward the
open end. When the piston makes the following
inward stroke, the mixture is compressed
and combustion occurs, the pressure from
which drives the piston outward on the power
stroke. This is followed by another inward
stroke, which pushes the burned gases out of
the cylinder. It will be seen that power is
developed during only one stroke of the four,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>the other three being required in the preparation
for the following power stroke. The movement
of the piston over these three dead strokes
is secured by attaching to the crank shaft a
heavy <b>fly wheel</b>, the momentum of which,
acquired during the power stroke, keeps the
crank shaft revolving and the piston in motion
while the events are performed.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image007" style="max-width: 60.125em;">

  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.—Gasoline Engine Cycle.</span></p></div>
</div>


<p>The space between the piston and cylinder
head in which the combustion occurs is called
the <b>combustion space</b>, and the <b>inlet</b> and <b>exhaust
valves</b> open into it, the first being that
by which the fresh mixture enters, and the
second that by which the products of combustion
escape. The device for igniting the mixture
projects into the combustion space, and
the means of ignition in universal use for
automobile engines is an electric spark.</p>


<h3>INLET STROKE</h3>

<p>During the stroke (Fig. 2), the piston is
moved outward by the crank shaft, which is
revolved either by hand or by the momentum
of the fly wheel. This movement increases
the size of the combustion space, thereby reducing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the pressure in it, and the higher pressure
of the atmosphere outside of the cylinder
will force fresh mixture into the combustion
space, the inlet valve being open to admit it.
If the piston moves slowly, the mixture will
be able to enter fast enough to keep the pressure
in the combustion space equal to that
outside, but at the high speed at which a gasoline
engine is run the piston will reach the end
of its stroke before a complete charge has had
time to enter, so that the pressure in the combustion
space will still be below that of the
atmosphere. If the inlet valve closed at this
point so that no more mixture could enter,
the combustion of the partial charge would
result in a lower pressure than would be possible
with a full charge; the inlet valve should
therefore remain open until the piston reaches
the point of its next inward stroke at which
the pressure in the cylinder equals that outside.</p>


<h3>COMPRESSION-COMBUSTION STROKE</h3>

<p>The compression and the combustion of the
charge occur during the next inward stroke of
the piston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>The period between the bringing together of
the liquid gasoline and air and its admission
to the cylinder is too brief to secure perfect
combination, and the mixture that results is
not satisfactory. A portion of the air will
not have been able to come into contact with
the gasoline, and much of the liquid will not
have been vaporized; what passes into the
cylinder consists of pure air, liquid gasoline,
and a more or less perfect mixture of the two.
The combustion of this would be slow and incomplete,
resulting in loss of power and waste
of fuel. In order to render the mixture more
perfect, advantage is taken of the heat that is
produced by compression; the inward stroke
of the piston raises the temperature of the mixture
by compressing it, the heat rendering the
gasoline more volatile, and the compression
forcing it into combination with the air. Even
this does not result in the formation of a perfect
mixture, for the period is too short to effect it.
The failure of an engine to deliver full power
may often be traced to this condition, for the
air and gasoline vapor, instead of being
thoroughly combined and mixed, will be in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
layers, so to speak, and the combustion will
be slow and uneven. Future development of
the internal combustion engine will no doubt
eradicate this, to the increase of efficiency and
economy.</p>

<p>The charge of inflammable mixture can produce
a certain amount of heat, and the more
rapidly and completely this heat is obtained,
the greater and more sudden will be the rise
in pressure. The pressure will be greater when
the mixture is contained in a small space than
when in a large, and as the combustion space
is smallest when the piston is at its inmost
point, the greatest pressure will be obtained
if combustion is complete at this point. If
the combustion of the mixture were instantaneous,
it should be ignited at this point;
but even though very rapid, it nevertheless
burns slowly enough to make it necessary to
ignite it sufficiently before the end of the
stroke to have the combustion complete as
the piston comes into position to move outward.
The instant at which the mixture must be
ignited in order to produce this result depends
on the speed of the piston, for the interval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
between the ignition of a good mixture and its
complete combustion does not vary to any
great extent. When the piston is moving
slowly, the mixture may be ignited toward the
end of the compression stroke, for there will
be sufficient time for complete combustion by
the time the stroke is ended; but when moving
at high speed, ignition must occur much earlier
in the stroke, as otherwise the piston will have
completed the compression stroke and begun
to move outward on the power stroke before
the mixture is entirely burned. The instant
at which ignition occurs also depends on the
mixture that is used, for its quality and proper
combination make a difference in the rapidity
with which it burns. The better the quality
of the mixture, the faster and more completely
it will burn, and ignition may occur later in
the stroke than would be possible with a mixture
of poor quality. As the mixture is ignited
by the passing of an electric spark in the combustion
space, the difference in the instant at
which it occurs may be secured by permitting
the spark to pass earlier or later, and this is
under the control of the driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>When ignition occurs early in the compression
stroke, the spark is said to be <b>advanced</b>,
in distinction to a <b>retarded</b> spark, which passes
when the compression stroke is more nearly
complete.</p>

<p>If the spark is advanced too much, combustion
will be complete before the piston has
reached the end of the compression stroke,
and it will be necessary to force it to the end of
the stroke against the pressure by the momentum
of the fly wheel, in order that it may get
into position to move outward on the power
stroke. In such a case, the momentum may
not be sufficient to overcome the pressure, and
the piston will be brought to a stop. A retarded
spark results in the combustion of the
mixture being completed after the piston has
begun to move outward on the power stroke,
and the pressure will then be reduced because
it is exerted in a larger space, the piston consequently
being moved with less force; if the
spark is still further retarded, the combustion
will not be complete by the time the exhaust
begins, and the heat from only a portion of
the mixture will be utilized, because it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
still be burning as it is forced out of the cylinder.</p>

<p>The position at which the spark occurs is
one of the means by which the speed of the
engine is controlled, for the low pressure that
results from a retarded spark moves the piston
at low speed, while the greater pressure from
an advanced spark drives the piston outward
with more force and higher velocity.</p>

<p>While high compression of the charge improves
its quality, and results in combustion
being more rapid and complete, it has limits,
and if carried too far the heat generated by
the compression will be sufficient to ignite the
mixture. This would have a bad effect on
the operation of the engine, for the pressure
would then be produced at the wrong point
of the stroke, retarding instead of assisting
the revolution of the crank shaft. Modern
practice has shown that in engines that are
maintained at a proper temperature the best
results are obtained by compressing the mixture
to from sixty to eighty pounds to the
square inch; there are instances in which a
higher compression is obtained, but the liability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
to ignite the mixture prematurely makes it
undesirable.</p>


<h3>POWER STROKE</h3>

<p>The increasing size of the combustion chamber
as the piston moves outward on the power
stroke permits the gases to expand, and in
doing so the temperature will fall, the pressure
decreasing in consequence. A further decrease
in pressure is caused by the hot gases being in
contact with the metal cylinder and piston,
which absorb heat. The more slowly the
engine runs, the longer the gases will be in contact
with the cylinder walls, and the more
opportunity there will be for loss of heat from
this cause; at higher speeds, there will be less
time for heat to be absorbed by the cylinder
walls, and more will be utilized in expanding
the gases and producing work.</p>

<p>Even at the outmost position of the piston,
the combustion space will not be large enough
to permit the gases to expand until their pressure
has dropped to that of the atmosphere, so that
they will still be exerting pressure. By opening
the exhaust valve, the gases will have an outlet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
for expansion, and will begin to rush out.
While the pressure might be utilized against
the piston to the end of the power stroke, it
has been found that better results are obtained
by opening the exhaust valve before the piston
reaches the end of the power stroke. There is
then a higher pressure forcing the gases out
than there would be later in the stroke, and
the greater quantity of gases that escapes leaves
less to be expelled during the exhaust stroke.</p>


<h3>EXHAUST STROKE</h3>

<p>The inward movement of the piston pushes
out of the open exhaust valve the gases that
have not escaped through their desire to expand.
The exhaust valve remains open for
the entire stroke, but when the engine is running
at high speed the piston moves so rapidly
that the gases cannot escape fast enough to
prevent their being slightly compressed. When
the piston is at its inmost point, the gases are
still flowing through the valve because of this
slight compression, and if the valve closed, a
portion would be retained. The best results
come from the closing of the exhaust valve not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
at the end of the exhaust stroke, but a short
time after the piston has begun to move outward
again, during which period the compression
forces the gases out. The exhaust valve
closes at the point when the slight compression
has been reduced to the pressure of the atmosphere
by the escape of the gases and the enlargement
of the combustion space.</p>

<p>If the piston completely filled the combustion
space when at its inmost point, all of
the burned gases would be expelled, but the
necessity for leaving a space in which combustion
may take place renders this impossible,
and a small portion of the burned gases therefore
remains in the cylinder. The space between
the cylinder head and the piston when at its
inmost point, called the <b>clearance</b>, should be
as small as possible, in order that the amount
of these gases remaining in the cylinder may
not be sufficient to contaminate the fresh
charge and weaken the pressure of its combustion.</p>

<p>The passages through which the burned
gases are led away from the cylinder must be
large and free from obstructions, for if a free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
flow is not permitted back pressure will be set
up, which will prevent the largest possible
amount of gases from escaping, and leave a
greater portion to contaminate the fresh charge.</p>

<p>The power that a gasoline engine is capable
of developing depends on the size of the cylinder,
the pressure acting on the piston, and the speed
at which it operates. A steam engine, which
obtains its pressure from a boiler, can do work
as soon as the steam is turned into the cylinder,
but a gasoline engine must be running before it
can be called on to deliver power. Because of
the cycle of events on which its operation
depends, the piston must be forced to perform
the inlet and compression strokes before pressure
can be developed, and it is necessary to
revolve the crank shaft by outside means until
a charge of mixture has been taken into the
cylinder, compressed, and ignited, when the
engine begins to work by the pressure from the
combustion, and takes up its cycle. Not until
this has been done can it be called on to do
work.</p>

<p>A steam engine can be made to deliver more
power than it is built for by increasing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
pressure acting against its piston, and the full
pressure of the boiler can be utilized when extra
work is necessary. The power developed by
a gasoline engine being greatly dependent on
its speed, and there being no reserve by which
greater power can be developed in emergencies,
it is necessary for an engine of this type to be
perfectly adapted to the work that is desired
of it. At excessive speeds the piston acquires
great momentum, which must be overcome at
each end of a stroke by the crank shaft, and
while a speed above normal may be attained,
it results in the quick destruction of the bearings
and the severe straining of the engine. The
best results in efficiency and long life accompany
the running of the engine at the slowest
speed possible for the development of the required
power.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The sudden and powerful outward movements
of the piston under the pressure
from the combustion are transmitted
to a <b>crank shaft</b>, which must be of great
strength in order to resist the heavy strains
under which it operates. It is made of the best
steel available for the purpose, and has as many
<b>cranks</b> as the engine has cylinders. The cranks
are generally made in one piece with the shaft
for the sake of strength, and for stiffness there
are as many <b>bearings</b> as possible. The number
of bearings for the crank shaft of an engine
with four or more cylinders depends on the
arrangement of the cylinders. If the cylinders
are evenly spaced, there will be room for a
bearing between each pair of cranks, so that a
four-cylinder engine will have five bearings,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>one at each end, the other three being between
the cranks. If the cylinders are in pairs, there
will not be room between the cranks of a pair
for a bearing, the only space for it being between
the pairs; a four-cylinder engine built in this
way will thus have but three bearings, one
at each end and one in the center. Crank
shafts are described
by their bearings as
three, five, etc., <b>point</b>
crank shafts.</p>

<p>The relative positions of the cranks of a

the <b>crank pin</b>, which may be likened to the
pedal, and to this the large end of the <b>connecting

to the piston. The connecting rod must
be of great strength, tough but not brittle,
and is made of steel or bronze.</p>

<p>The piston is a trifle smaller than the bore of
the cylinder, and its length is usually greater than
its diameter. It is hollow, with one end closed,
the closed end being that against which the
pressure is exerted. A <b>wrist pin</b> passes through
it, and through the small end of the connecting
rod, to enable the latter to swing from side to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
side in following the turning of the crank shaft.
A tight joint is maintained between it and the
cylinder walls by cast-iron <b>piston rings</b>, which
are of square or rectangular cross-section,
split so that they may spring open, and fitted
into grooves cut around the piston. They are
of such shape that their tendency to expand
keeps them pressed against the cylinder walls,
but being split, their elasticity prevents their
binding; they fit the grooves
snugly, and while they may
move freely in them, they
hold the pressure from escaping.
The number of rings
varies with the design of the
engine, but the most usual arrangement is three
to a piston, placed around the upper end.</p>

Valve in Cage.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The <b>valve</b> openings, or <b>seats</b>, are circular,
and are usually made slightly funnel shaped,
the <b>disks</b> that cover them being slightly conical
to fit. The large
end of the funnel is
toward the combustion
space, so that when the disk is lifted
from its seat it moves inward. Valves are
held against their seats by coil springs that
surround the valve <b>stems</b>, which are rods extending
from the center of the disks, and there
are two methods by which they are opened.
In an <b>automatic valve</b>, the spring that holds
the disk against its seat is weak, and the higher
pressure outside of the cylinder during the
suction stroke forces the disk away from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
seat against the pressure of the spring. The
valve remains open until the pressure in the
combustion space is about equal to that outside,
when the spring draws the disk back to its seat,
to which it is held as long as the pressure inside
is higher than that of the atmosphere. This
arrangement is only possible for inlet valves,
and is largely used, but exhaust valves, and
often inlet valves as well, are <b>mechanically
operated</b>; that is, they are opened and held
open by a mechanism driven by the crank
shaft, in the form of a <b>cam</b>. A cam can best
be described as a “wheel with a hump on it,”
or, in other words, it is a piece of metal mounted
on a shaft, cylindrical in form except for one
portion, which projects farther from the shaft
than the rest. The cam revolves with the
shaft, and the projection, called the <b>nose</b>, will
displace anything resting against it. The
illustration shows a cam in three positions of
its revolution, with the end of a valve stem
resting against it—the roller being attached
to the stem to reduce the friction. The valve
stem is held in <b>guides</b>, so that the only movement
it may have is up and down; when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
cam revolves, the nose lifts the stem and opens
the valve, holds it open as long as the flat end
of the cam is under the stem, and when the nose
passes from under, the valve is drawn to its
seat by the spring.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image027" style="max-width: 62.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image027.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.—Cam Action.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The moment at which an automatic valve
opens is governed partly by the tension of its
spring; if it is too strong, greater pressure will
be required to open it, and it will close sooner
than if the tension is light. Accurate adjustment
of this spring is necessary in order that
the charge may enter the combustion space
without delay, and continue to enter as long as
possible. The opening and closing of mechanically
operated valves depend on the shape of
the cam, and not being affected by the more
or less uncertain action of a spring, they are
more positive in action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>The <b>cam shaft</b> on which the cam is mounted
is driven by the crank shaft, but as the valve
opens but once during two revolutions, the
cam shaft revolves at half speed, making one
revolution while the crank shaft makes two.
This is done by means of <b>gears</b>.</p>

<p>If two gears running together, or in mesh,
have the same number of teeth, they will make
the same number of revolutions, but if one has
twice as many teeth as the other, the smaller
will revolve twice while the larger revolves once.
As the cam shaft must revolve but once while
the crank shaft revolves twice, its gear must
have twice the number of teeth as the gear on
the crank shaft. The cam shaft is also called
the <b>secondary</b>, or <b>half-time shaft</b>, and the gears
that drive it the <b>two-to-one gears</b>.</p>

<p>In some designs of engines, the nose of the
cam bears directly against the valve stem, but
it is more usual to place a <b>valve-lifter rod</b>, or
<b>push rod</b>, between them, the cam acting on the
rod and lifting it, and that in turn lifting the
valve stem. When the nose of the cam is not
acting on the stem or rod, there must be a small
space between them, for if the stem or rod<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
rests firmly against the cam at all times, the
valve disk might be prevented from seating
firmly. The space is left between the stem and
lifter rod, the spring acting only on the stem.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image029.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.—Four Arrangements of Valves.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The valves may open into the cylinder in a
variety of ways; both may be in one <b>pocket</b>,
or one may be in a pocket and the other in
the head, or each in a separate pocket, or both
in the head. The first two illustrations show
automatic inlet valves, and the third and fourth
mechanically operated valves; when two mechanically
operated valves are in the head, it
is necessary to open them by means of <b>rocker
arms</b>, for because of their position it would be
impossible for the valve-lifter rod to act directly
on their stems.</p>

<p>If after the explosion the burned gases were
permitted to escape directly into the open air
from the cylinder, the effect would be the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
as the firing of a gun, and for the same reasons.
The pressure in the cylinder being higher than
that of the atmosphere, the sudden expansion
of the gases would produce a report, and as this
would be most undesirable for an automobile,
provision is made by which the gases are cooled
and permitted to expand gradually, so that
when they reach the open air they are at its
pressure, or nearly so. This is done in the
<b>muffler</b>, or <b>silencer</b>, to which the <b>exhaust pipe</b>
conducts the products of combustion. The
muffler consists of a series of chambers of
different sizes, one inside of the other; the
gases pass from the smaller to the larger, expanding
as they go, until from the largest they
should escape without noise, having lost their
heat and pressure.</p>

<p>While the pressure exerted during the power
stroke depends on the heat of the gases, and
it is necessary to have the engine hot in order
that there may be as little loss of heat as possible,
the temperature must not be permitted
to rise to the point at which the lubricating oil
would burn. Lubricating oil for gasoline engines
is made to stand high heat, but if heated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
beyond its limit it will burn, and then, besides
the loss of its property of lubrication, a deposit
of carbon, hard or gummy, will form, fouling
the combustion space or piston rings, and
interfering with the operation of the engine.
Overheating is prevented either by circulating
water through channels surrounding the combustion
space, or by directing a blast of air
against it.</p>

<p>The channels, called <b>water jackets</b>, provided
for the circulation of the water, are usually
cast with the cylinder, or formed of sheet metal.
Cool water enters at the bottom and escapes
at the top, absorbing heat during its passage.
Of the two systems of keeping the water in
circulation, the most usual consists of a rotary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
pump, which forces the water through the
jackets and then to a <b>cooler</b>, or <b>radiator</b>, which
is so placed that it is exposed to the air currents
set up as the car moves. In order to cool the
water, the radiator must have a large surface
exposed to the air, and the water must pass
through it in small streams. The early types
consisted of coils of small copper tubing, on
which were strung disks of copper, the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
flowing through the tubing, and the disks absorbing
its heat and giving it up to the air,
but these are being abandoned in favor of
<b>cellular</b> or <b>honeycomb</b> radiators. These types,
which are usually placed at the extreme front
of the car, are made up of a great number of
short lengths of small tubing,
in any one of several
shapes, placed side by side,
and held together either by
plates or by soldering their
ends.</p>

<p>The heated water enters
at the top of the case in
which the tubes are contained, and flows to
the bottom, finding passages between the tubes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
while the air passes through, being assisted by
a fan driven by the engine.</p>

<p>The second system of keeping the water in
circulation follows the principle that heated
water tends to rise, its place being taken by
the cooler water that tends to sink. This,
called the <b>thermosiphon</b> or <b>gravity</b> system,
requires all of the parts and connections to be
large and completely filled with water. The
water in the jacket rises as it absorbs heat from
the cylinder walls, and flows out to the radiator,
which it enters at the top. Its place in the
jacket is taken by the cooled water from the
bottom of the radiator, and this circulation
continues, being more rapid as the difference
in temperature between the heated and cooled
water increases. It is naturally not so rapid
as circulation that is forced by a pump, and
more liable to become inoperative by the
clogging of the pipes, jacket, or radiator.</p>

<p>Of the methods of increasing the surface of
a cylinder in order to cool it by a blast of air,
the most usual is to cast it with flanges that
project from all parts of the combustion space.
These become heated as the temperature of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
cylinder walls increases, and the air that is
blown against them carries off the heat. Other
methods consist of setting pins or copper strips
into the cylinder walls, of such form that the
air current strikes a surface composed of points,
by which the heat easily passes to the air.
Another system consists of surrounding the
combustion chamber with a jacket open at
the bottom, air being blown into it from the
top by a powerful blower.</p>

<p>Other things that are necessary for successful
air cooling are large valves by which the hot
gases may be quickly discharged when their
period of usefulness is ended, and small cylinders
rather than large, as the heat from small
quantities of gases may be carried off more
quickly than from large.</p>

<p>The lubrication of a gasoline engine must be
carefully looked after, as on its thoroughness
depends the continued delivery of power.
The most usual method of lubricating the
piston and cylinder walls is to keep the crank
case filled with oil to such a point that the end
of the connecting rod dips into it in turning.
This spatters the oil to all parts of the crank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
case, and a portion is caught in a groove cut
around the lower end of the piston. The inward
movement of the piston spreads the oil on
the cylinder walls, and it is distributed around
the piston rings, so that they move easily in
their grooves. As the oil is used up, it is replaced
from a <b>lubricator</b> so that a constant level is
maintained, and this operates either by gravity,
or by a small force pump driven by the engine, or
by the maintaining of pressure in the oil tank.</p>

<p>Mechanically operated or pressure lubricators
supply oil to all parts of the engine, and as the
quantity passed to each bearing is adjustable,
a feed may be maintained that is exactly suited
to the requirements.</p>

<p>The bearings of an automobile operate under
such widely different conditions that one
kind of lubricant will not be suitable for all.
The maker of the car has tested the different
oils, and it is advisable to follow his instructions
on the brand and grade most suitable for each
bearing, rather than to try experiments. The
Lubrication Table on pages 244 and 245 gives
the kind and quantity of lubricant most suitable
to the work performed by each bearing.</p>

<span class="fs80">ENGINE BALANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A drawback to the use of reciprocating
engines is that the weight of the
piston and connecting rod in sliding
first one way and then the other produces great
vibration, and that the crank shaft in bringing
these parts to a stop at each end of the stroke
is subjected to violent shocks that in time wear
it loose in its bearings. With internal-combustion
engines this vibration, and the shock
on the crank shaft, are greatly increased by the
intensity with which the pressure is exerted.</p>

<p>Engines with one cylinder may be balanced
to some extent by the use of counterweights
attached to the crank shaft, and by the use of
so heavy a fly wheel that its momentum produces
a comparatively steady movement; but
a perfect absorption of the vibration would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
require the engine to be run at a constant speed,
which is not possible with those used on automobiles.</p>

<p>In two-cylinder engines the vibration may
be reduced by so arranging the parts that the
pistons slide in opposite directions, the weight
of one being balanced by that of the other.
This plan is used in engines of the <b>horizontal
double-opposed</b> type, which is considered to be
the most satisfactory for low powers. The
cylinders are horizontal, with their open ends
toward each other, the crank shaft lying between
them. The crank shaft is <b>two-throw</b>,
180°; that is, there are two pairs of crank
arms, projecting from opposite sides of the
shaft, so that they are a half revolution apart.</p>

<p>Two cylinder engines are also built with
vertical cylinders, and are of two types, according
to the construction of the crank shaft. In
one, the crank shaft is 180°, and in the other
both pairs of crank arms project from the same
side of the shaft so that the crank pins are in
line, this being called a 360° crank shaft.</p>

<p>In the 180° type one piston moves up as
the other moves down, so that they balance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
but it results in the power strokes occurring
in both cylinders during one revolution of the
crank shaft, with no power during the revolution
that follows.</p>

<p>To understand the reason for this, the order
in which the events of the cycle occur must be
recalled, and it must be remembered that of
the four strokes of the piston during which they
are performed the two outward strokes are inlet
and power, and the two inward strokes compression
and exhaust. If the piston of a two-cylinder
vertical engine (Fig. 17) is moving
downward on the power stroke, piston No. 2
will be ascending, and the only events that can
then be performed in its cylinder are compression
or exhaust. If performing compression,
it will move under power during the next
stroke (the other half of the revolution), No. 1
then exhausting (Table No. 1). This brings
the two power strokes in one revolution, and
during the next revolution there will be no
power stroke, for No. 1 will be performing
suction and compression, and No. 2 exhaust
and suction.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.—Engine Arrangements Showing Order of Firing.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>If, as shown in the second table, No. 2 is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>moving upward on exhaust while No. 1 moves
down under power, its previous stroke, the
first half of the revolution, will have been the
power stroke, and the same condition will exist
of two power strokes occurring in the same
revolution.</p>

<p>In either case the balance of the moving
parts is offset by the irregular production of
power, which produces bad results in the setting
up of strains in the engine, and the uneven
running of the car.</p>

<p>In two-cylinder vertical engines with 360°
crank shaft (Fig. 17) the pistons move up and
down together, which of course results in bad
balance. In this arrangement, however, the
applications of power may be evenly spaced,
for as the piston in cylinder No. 1 moves downward
on the power stroke, piston No. 2 moves
in the same direction, and may make either
the inlet or power stroke. If it makes the inlet
stroke, it must move inward before it can again
move outward on the power stroke, and there
will be an interval of one stroke between the
power strokes of the two cylinders. To have
the power strokes in the two cylinders occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
together, as suggested as the alternative, would
obviously give bad results in the great strain
imposed on the crank shaft, the weight of the
fly wheel that would be necessary to carry
two pistons through three dead strokes, and
the jerky running of the car.</p>

<p>The defects of two-cylinder vertical engines
with either design of crank shaft outweigh any
possible advantage of that construction, and
the horizontal double-opposed type, in evenly
occurring power strokes, mechanical balance,
and simplicity, is in almost universal use for
cars of low power.</p>

<p>A two-cylinder engine does not require so
heavy a fly wheel as a one-cylinder engine in
proportion to the power delivered, because there
is a power stroke every revolution instead of
in alternate revolutions, and the parts must
be carried over only one dead stroke instead
of three. Similarly, the fly wheel of a four-cylinder
engine may be still lighter, for in that
type there are two power strokes in every
revolution, with no dead strokes. At the
same time, it is not possible to dispense with it
entirely, for the pressure acting on the piston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
at the beginning of the power stroke falls
rapidly as the piston moves before it, and the
momentum by which the fly wheel tends to
revolve at a constant speed steadies and smooths
what would otherwise be a jerky motion.</p>

<p>The crank shaft of a four-cylinder engine is
180°, four-throw, with the two end cranks
projecting in the opposite direction to that
of the two inside cranks. This arrangement
is used in preference to having the cranks
project alternately; that is, the first and third
to one side and the second and fourth to the
other, because of economy in manufacturing,
and because practice has shown that it results
in less vibration in the running of the engine.</p>

<p>This construction of the crank shaft does not
permit the power strokes to occur in rotation,
cylinder No. 2 following No 1, and then Nos.
3 and 4, for it has been explained that when
cranks are 180° apart the power strokes occur
during one revolution, and that when 360°
apart there is a dead stroke between the two
power strokes. Cranks 1 and 2 are 180° apart,
as are 3 and 4, and also 2 and 4, but 2 and 3
are 360°; that is, their crank pins are in line,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
which is also the case with 1 and 4. The
power stroke in cylinder No. 2 may follow that
in cylinder No. 1, but must be followed by that
in cylinder No. 4, as that is 180° away from
No. 2, and No. 3 comes last, being 180° from
No. 4. The succession in which the power
strokes occur, called the <b>firing order</b>, is thus
1, 2, 4, 3, and this is arranged for by the setting
of the valves and the timing of the ignition.</p>

<p>This firing order was used for the first four-cylinder
automobile engines, but it has lately
been suggested that the firing order 1, 3, 4, 2
shows advantages in the reduction of strains
and vibration, and is being adopted.</p>

<p>Three-cylinder engines are built with 120°
crank shafts; that is, the cranks are one third
of a revolution apart, instead of one half of a
revolution, as is the case with 180° crank shafts.
This gives three power strokes during two
revolutions, and results in excellent balance.
Six-cylinder engines have crank shafts of
similar construction, and produce six power
strokes during two revolutions, with the best
balance that it is possible to obtain without
an excessive number of cylinders. A power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
stroke occurs at every 120° that the crank
shaft revolves, and as each power stroke endures
for a half revolution, or 180°, it follows
that one commences when the previous one is
only two thirds complete. This gives a very
steady application of power, for the crank
shaft is at all times operated by the driving
effect of the combustion strokes, and it is
possible to run the engine smoothly at greatly
varying speeds by control of the position at
which the spark occurs in the combustion
space, and the admission of a greater or less
volume of the mixture during the inlet stroke.</p>

<p>The type of engine that will give satisfaction
depends on the work that is demanded of it,
the care that it will receive, and the knowledge
of the operator. A one-cylinder engine, having
a minimum of parts, may be successfully managed
by a novice, but its vibration, and the
fact that it delivers power for only one fourth
of the time that it runs, make it unsatisfactory
for any but light work. Cars of medium
power are almost universally equipped with
horizontal double-opposed engines, with excellent
results, and they are not difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
maintain. More powerful cars have four-cylinder
vertical engines, which give a sufficiently
constant pull for all practical purposes,
with a correspondingly greater demand for
care and attention. Six-cylinder engines are
of doubtful advantage for general use, without
the services of a chauffeur, for while they
develop more constant power than engines
with fewer cylinders, the complication of
parts and the care necessary are increased.</p>

TWO-CYCLE ENGINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The two-cycle type of gasoline engine
differs from the four-cycle type described
in the foregoing chapters in
that the five events composing the cycle are
performed during one revolution of the crank
shaft, or two strokes of the piston, power being
developed during every outward stroke of the
piston instead of alternate outward strokes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image048" style="max-width: 50.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image048.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.—Two-Cycle Engine.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In order that this result may be attained,
the construction of the engine is changed, and,
as will be seen in Fig. 18, the crank case is
utilized as a receiver for the mixture before it
passes to the combustion space. The valves
are replaced by <b>ports</b>, which are openings into
the combustion space that are covered and
uncovered by the piston as it slides in the
cylinder. The <b>inlet port</b> is uncovered when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>the piston is at the inmost point of its stroke
(Fig. 18, A), and then admits the mixture to the
crank case; the <b>by-pass port</b> and the <b>exhaust
port</b> are uncovered when the piston is at the
outmost point of its stroke (Fig. 18, B), the former
then permitting the mixture to pass from the
crank case to the combustion space, and the
latter is that through which the burned gases
escape after combustion has taken place.</p>

<p>During an inward stroke, the pressure in the
crank case is reduced as the piston slides away
from it, and fresh mixture is forced into it by
the higher atmospheric pressure as soon as the
inlet port is uncovered. This port is covered
when the piston makes an outward stroke,
and the mixture, not being able to escape, is
compressed. Its tendency to expand causes
it to flow to the combustion space when the
by-pass port is uncovered, and in entering it
strikes a ledge on the piston so that it is deflected
to the top of the combustion space
instead of being able to shoot across the cylinder
and out the open exhaust port. The inward
stroke of the piston covers these two ports and
compresses the mixture, ignition occurring in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
the regular manner. The pressure developed
by the combustion drives the piston outward,
and as soon as the exhaust port is uncovered
(which is slightly before the uncovering of the
by-pass port), the gases, which are still expanding,
begin to escape, and are further expelled
by the fresh charge that enters and drives them
before it. Thus the five events of the cycle are
performed during an inward and an outward
stroke of the piston, the crank case end of the
piston drawing a charge of fresh mixture into
the crank case and forcing it into the combustion
space, and the combustion chamber
end compressing it and being acted on by the
pressure from the combustion.</p>

<p>At slow speeds, two-cycle engines have advantages
over the four-cycle type in the production
of a power stroke at every revolution
of the crank shaft, and the absence of valves
and valve mechanism with their weight and
possibility of giving trouble. This simplicity
makes the two-cycle engine popular for motor
boats, where they are run at slow and constant
speed, but for higher and changing
speeds these advantages are outweighed by disadvantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
that show little sign of being overcome.</p>

<p>With the engine running at a thousand
revolutions a minute, it can be understood
that the ports will be open for only a brief
period during each stroke, and that the faster
the engine runs the shorter will be the period
during which the gases may enter or leave the
combustion space. The inefficiency of two-cycle
engines as compared with engines of the
four-cycle type is due entirely to the fact that
the burned gases have not sufficient time in
which to escape from the combustion space,
nor the fresh charge time to enter. The fresh
charge that does enter being incomplete, and
being contaminated by the portion of the
burned gases that has not been able to escape,
result in the “choking up” of the engine, and
in the production of lower power than the
dimensions and weight of the engine should
warrant.</p>

<span class="fs80">CARBURETION AND GASOLINE FEEDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Pure gasoline vapor will not burn, and in
order to render it inflammable it must
be combined with oxygen. The simplest
manner of effecting this is to mix air
with it, and when the correct proportions are
obtained, the oxygen supplied by the air will
be sufficient to result in the complete combustion
of the gasoline vapor, without a surplus
of either of the ingredients. This mixing is
called <b>carburetion</b>, the air being said to be
<b>carbureted</b>. A correct proportion of gasoline
vapor and air results in rapid combustion; an
excess of air makes combustion slower, and
excess of gasoline vapor prevents the combustion
from being complete, a residue of carbon
remaining. The correct proportions of air
and gasoline vapor are obtained by the use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
a device called a <b>carburetor</b>, which is connected
to the combustion chamber by the <b>inlet pipe</b>,
and in such a manner that everything entering
the combustion space by the inlet valve must
first pass through it.</p>

<p>Liquid gasoline is led to the carburetor
from the supply tank, and the air enters it when
the pressure in the combustion space is reduced
by the piston in making the inlet stroke. The
speed with which the air flows through the
carburetor depends on the extent to which the
pressure is reduced, and the gasoline vapor that
is required to form a mixture of the correct
proportion must be maintained in accordance
with it. While there are various classes of
carburetors, practically all that are used for
automobile engines are of the <b>float-feed</b> type;
that is, the supply of gasoline is maintained by
a <b>float</b>, just as water tanks are kept filled to a
desired depth by a hollow metal ball that floats
on the liquid and controls the valve by which
the water enters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image054" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image054.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.—Carburetor Principles.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The principal parts of a float-feed carburetor
are the <b>float chamber</b> and the <b>mixing chamber</b>,
the gasoline flowing from the supply tank to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>the float chamber, and from there to the mixing
chamber, where it is combined with the air.
The gasoline flows out of the float chamber
through a small pipe, the end of which, called
the <b>spray nozzle</b>, projects into the mixing
chamber so that the current of air rushes past
its tip (Fig. 19). When the inlet stroke is not
being performed, and there is no air passing
through the mixing chamber, the float in the
float chamber keeps the gasoline at such a level
that it stands just below the tip of the spray
nozzle. In this condition the gasoline in both
the float chamber and the spray nozzle is under
atmospheric pressure; but when the pressure
in the combustion space is reduced as the piston
makes the inlet stroke, the pressure in the inlet
pipe and mixing chamber is also reduced, and
the gasoline will be forced out of the spray
nozzle by the higher pressure in the float chamber.
The passage in the tip of the spray nozzle
is small, and the gasoline is broken up into
fine drops as it spurts out, and in this condition
is partly absorbed by the air and partly carried
into the cylinder. By regulating the amount
of gasoline that may pass out of the spray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
nozzle, it may be adjusted to the volume of
air flowing through the mixing chamber, so
that any desired proportion may be obtained.</p>

<p>If the engine were to be run at a constant
speed, the relative pressures on the gasoline
in the float chamber and spray nozzle, and the
quantity of gasoline forced out of the spray
nozzle, would remain in correct proportion to
the volume of air; but as the engine of an automobile
is run at greatly varying speeds, the
pressure in the mixing chamber is not constant,
but varies to correspond. If the piston makes
fifty inlet strokes a minute, the reduction of
the pressure in the mixing chamber is more
gradual than would be the case with the piston
making two hundred inlet strokes a minute.
The more rapidly the pressure is reduced, the
greater will be the effect of the unchanging
atmospheric pressure in the float chamber,
and the more gasoline will be forced out of the
spray nozzle. This will result in the presence
of too much gasoline in proportion to the air,
giving a mixture that is <b>too rich</b>. It is therefore
necessary to provide an arrangement by
which the pressure in the mixing chamber will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
not be changed as the speed of the engine
varies, and this is accomplished by the <b>auxiliary
air inlet</b>, which is closed when the engine
runs slowly, but opens to correspond with increasing
speed (Fig. 19). The faster the engine
runs, the more the auxiliary air inlet will open,
to admit a correspondingly greater amount of
air to prevent the pressure in the mixing
chamber from being reduced below the point at
which the required amount of gasoline is forced
out of the spray nozzle.</p>

<p>The most rapid combination of the gasoline
and air is secured by breaking the gasoline up
into fine spray as it leaves the nozzle. In order
to break the gasoline into fine particles, the
tip of the spray nozzle is made with a fine
opening, and often forms the seat for the gasoline
adjusting valve, which is a needle-pointed
rod that is screwed in or out to reduce or enlarge
the opening; a further breaking up results
from the placing of a metal cone, or the end of a
rod, in such a position as to be struck by the
gasoline as it flows out.</p>

<p>A carburetor with an auxiliary air inlet is
provided with two points of adjustment, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
control the flow of gasoline from the float
chamber to the spray nozzle, and to govern the
admission of the auxiliary air. The flow of
gasoline must be just sufficient to carburet
thoroughly the air passing through the mixing
chamber when the engine runs at low speed,
and the auxiliary air inlet must open to correspond
with increasing speed, to admit sufficient
air to keep the pressure reduced to proper proportions.</p>

<p>The auxiliary air inlet may be operated either
by the reduced pressure that permits the atmospheric
pressure to open a valve, or by the
governor of the engine, which opens the inlet
as the speed increases, and closes it on slowing
down. The first of these two types, called an
<b>automatic carburetor</b>, is in most general use for
automobiles, and is sufficiently satisfactory,
but is not as accurate as the <b>mechanically controlled</b>
type, which acts independently of pressure,
and exactly according to the speed of the
engine.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.—Automatic Carburetors.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Carburetors may be divided into two types,
according to design: those in which the float
and mixing chambers are side by side, and those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>in which the mixing chamber passes through
the center of the float chamber (Fig. 20). The
former is along the lines of the first forms of
float-feed carburetors, and the latter is of more
recent design, its object being a more compact
device, and one that is not affected by a change
of level when the car is on a hill. Both have
advantages and disadvantages, and the use of
one as against the other is optional and a matter
of opinion.</p>

<p>The carburetors illustrated are not of any
particular makes, and are intended to show
principles rather than construction.</p>

<p>In carburetors with a side mixing chamber
the float is usually a metal box, the joints of
which are as far as possible proof against leakage.
Guides prevent it from having any but
an up-and-down motion, and in thus moving
it controls the gasoline inlet valve by a rod
attached to it, or by a separate valve stem.
In this carburetor a separate valve stem is
used, and it is moved through the action of a
rocker arm controlled by the float. This construction
is usual when the gasoline enters the
float chamber from the bottom, the flow being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
permitted or checked by a needle valve. When
the level in the float chamber drops as the
gasoline runs out of the spray nozzle, the float
sinks, and lifts the valve point from its seat.
This admits gasoline from the supply tank,
and the float in rising on it depresses the valve
point, shutting off the flow. The gasoline
adjusting valve is in the passage between the
float and mixing chambers. The main or
initial air inlet is in the side, the air being
drawn through the mixing chamber, and past
the spray nozzle. The auxiliary air inlet is a
simple valve, opening inward, and held against
its seat by a coil spring, the tension of which is
adjustable. The pressure in the mixing chamber
being reduced in accordance with the increasing
speed of the engine, the valve is opened
more and more as the atmospheric pressure
against the outer surface of the valve overcomes
the tension of the spring.</p>

<p>In carburetors with central mixing chamber
the float is ring- or horseshoe-shaped, and
usually made of cork, well varnished to prevent
the absorption of the gasoline. The air
enters at the bottom, passing directly to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
mixing chamber. The auxiliary air inlet is at
the top, and is of the arrangement already
described. The mixture passes out at the side,
and may be controlled by a <b>throttle</b>, which
may be a damper arrangement, as shown, or
other device by which the quantity passing
to the combustion space is at the will of the
operator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.—Mechanically Controlled Carburetor.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The float and mixing chambers of a mechanically
operated carburetor are the same as in
the side-float chamber type, the difference
being in the control of the auxiliary air inlet
(Fig. 21). This consists of a tube attached to
the mixture outlet, within it sliding another
tube moved by the governor as that expands
or contracts with the speed of the engine.
There are openings in the sides of both tubes,
but when the sliding tube is at its inmost position
these are not in line, and consequently
are closed. When the governor acts with increased
engine speed, the sliding tube is drawn
out, and one or more openings come into line,
air entering through them to the mixing chamber.
The faster the engine runs, the larger
become the openings, and in consequence the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>greater is the amount of air that they admit.
The illustration shows the ball type of gasoline
valve, the ball on the end of the valve stem
being drawn against its seat as the float rises.</p>

<p>While these types are in practically universal
use for automobile engines, there are other
methods by which the proportions of the mixture
may be maintained. In one form the
gasoline drops on a funnel made of fine wire
gauze, which is placed in the mixing chamber
in such a manner that the air in entering passes
through it. The liquid forms a film over the
gauze, and is picked up by the air, as it is in a
condition that permits it to evaporate rapidly.
In surface carburetors air is forced through
the gasoline tank, or through an absorbent
material soaked with gasoline, and becomes
thoroughly saturated. This mixture is then
thinned with pure air until the desired proportion
is obtained, when it passes to the combustion
space. The objections to these forms
arise from the clogging of the parts with the
impurities present in gasoline, and while they
give excellent results when new, they deteriorate
rapidly and present such resistance to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>the flow of the air current that they become
useless.</p>

<p>There are two methods of supplying the
carburetor with gasoline. Of these the most
usual is the <b>gravity feed</b>, in which the tank is
placed at a higher level than the carburetor,
so that the gasoline flows down to it. The
tank is usually placed under the seat, and the
piping so arranged that the carburetor is the
lowest point of the system. This method of
feeding is satisfactory if the tank can be placed
sufficiently above the carburetor to have the
flow unaffected by an ordinary hill, but if it is
not so placed, a steep ascent may tilt the car
to such an extent that the carburetor is above
the level of the gasoline in the tank, in which
case the flow of course ceases.</p>

<p>The <b>pressure feed</b>, which has been adopted on
all high-grade cars, operates through the maintenance
of pressure in the supply tank, the
gasoline being forced out without regard to
gravity. The tank is tight, so that the pressure
cannot escape, and is connected by a long pipe
of small diameter either with the combustion
space of one of the cylinders or with the exhaust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>pipe, so that the pressure of the burned gases
is maintained in it. As the pressure cannot
exist until the engine is running, a hand air
pump is usually provided, by which a sufficient
pressure may be produced in the tank to force
out enough gasoline for starting. It is necessary
to use as long a pressure pipe as possible, in
order to prevent the possibility of flame passing
through it to the supply of fuel, a long pipe,
exposed to the air, cooling the gases to such an
extent that they cannot ignite the gasoline.</p>

<p>The pressure pipe is always fitted with a
<b>check and relief valve</b>, which acts as a safety
valve in preventing the pressure in the tank
from reaching a point at which the joints might
be strained, and also retains the pressure which
would otherwise escape when the engine stops.
In some cars an auxiliary gasoline tank is
provided on the dash, being fed by pressure
from the main tank, and from which gasoline
flows to the carburetor by gravity. The short
distance of this tank from the carburetor and
its elevation prevent the possibility of the flow
being stopped by any tilting of the car short
of an upset.</p>

<p>Because of the liability of the presence of
water in the gasoline, as well as dirt and grit,
the gasoline line should be fitted with a <b>strainer</b>,
or <b>trap</b>. This may be in any position, but it
is usual to have it close to the carburetor, if
not built into it. The simplest strainer consists
of a number of thicknesses of fine wire
gauze, so arranged that it may be easily taken
out for cleaning. This will separate the dirt
from the gasoline, and water may be caught in
a trap, which is a pocket where the water,
being heavier than the gasoline, may settle
and be drawn off.</p>


<h3>CARBURETOR PARTS</h3>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23B.—Types of Auxiliary Air Inlets.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Practically all the carburetors on the market
are combinations of a few forms of float valves,
auxiliary air inlets, and spray nozzles. In addition
to the forms shown in Figs. 20 and 21,
the most usual float valves may be seen in Fig.
23A. In the first two types shown in this diagram,
the float valve stems are separate from
the floats, and are sufficiently heavy to shut off
the flow of gasoline by their weight. In the
third type, the gasoline enters the float chamber
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>from the top, and as the valve stem is attached
to the float, the rising of the float results in the
shutting off of the gasoline. The fourth type
is in use on carburetors with central mixing
chambers, the float being hinged to one wall of
the float chamber. The loose valve stem is supported
by the hinge, and rises to a seat in the
valve when the gasoline is at the proper depth
on the float chamber.</p>




<p>Fig. 23B illustrates the most usual forms of
auxiliary air inlets. In the first type, the valve
disk slides on the valve stem, and enlarges the
size of the main air inlet. All of the air thus
passes the spray nozzle. In the second type,
the inlet for the auxiliary air is separate from
the main air inlet, the two currents meeting in
the mixing chamber, and the extra air diluting
the rich mixture that is formed at the spray
nozzle. This action is more correct in theory
than that of the preceding type, and better
practical results are obtained from it. These
air valves are defective in opening and closing
too abruptly, and in tending to vibrate rather
than to remain open a fixed distance. The air
inlet illustrated in the fourth diagram was designed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
to overcome these faults. When the
engine is not operating, the air inlets are closed
by a hollow piston that is held up by a spring.
The upper part of the piston rod carries a metal
disk that is attached by a flexible leather
washer to the walls of an upper chamber. The
portion of the chamber above the disk is tightly
closed, except for a small hole in the cover that
provides the only communication between the
atmosphere and the air confined in the chamber.
When the engine runs at speed, the atmospheric
pressure against the upper side of
the disk is greater than the pressure against the
lower side, and the disk is therefore forced
downward against the action of the spring.
The movement of the disk moves the piston,
and as this latter slides downward it uncovers
the openings and admits air. The small size
of the opening in the cover prevents air from
entering or leaving the chamber above the disk
rapidly, and the movement of the piston is
therefore steady and free from jerks. The
third diagram illustrates two positions of a
mechanically operated auxiliary air inlet,
controlled by a governor.</p>

<span class="fs80">IGNITION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The charge of explosive mixture in the
combustion space is ignited, or set
on fire, by an electric spark, and the
apparatus for producing and controlling this
spark is called the <em>ignition system</em>. It is with
this part of the mechanism of an automobile
that a novice has the greatest difficulty, for an
electric current is usually regarded as being
surrounded by an air of mystery. It does its
work silently and without visible reason, and
when it fails the average man is under the
necessity of beginning at the beginning and
examining all of the parts of the system because
he has so little understanding of the why of
it that he is unable to locate trouble in any but
a rule-of-thumb method. The principles of
electricity may be involved, but the production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
of a current, its handling, and the uses to which
it may be put are not difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Speaking broadly, the parts of the ignition
system are the source of current, the arrangement
in the combustion space at which the
spark is produced, the device by which the
instant when the spark passes may be controlled,
and the circuit by which these parts are connected.
Before going into a description of
these, however, it is necessary to understand
something of the nature and action of an
electric current.</p>

<p>Every generator of electricity has two <b>terminals</b>,
or <b>poles</b>, and the flow of current from
one to the other is due to what may be explained
as a difference in pressure between
them. This difference in pressure is similar
to that existing when two tanks, one full of
water and the other empty, are connected by a
pipe. The water will flow from the full to the
empty tank as long as there is a difference in
level, which is the same thing as a difference
in pressure, the flow ceasing when the water in
one tank is level with that in the other. When
a path is provided between the two poles of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
generator, the current will flow from one to
the other, always in the same direction, leaving
by the <b>positive pole</b> and returning by the <b>negative</b>.</p>

<p>Because of this tendency to flow, the current
may be made to perform work, for it will light
a lamp, ring a bell, or do anything else within
its power in order that it may flow from the
positive pole of the generator to the negative.
In this there is also a similarity to the two
tanks, for if a water wheel is placed in the pipe
connecting them, the flow of water from one
to the other will operate it.</p>

<p>The path over which the current flows may
be formed of any <b>conductor</b> of electricity, such
as carbon or any metal; substances by which
the current will not flow are called <b>nonconductors</b>
or <b>insulators</b>, and those in most common
use are rubber, china and glass, wood,
wood fiber, mica, etc.</p>

<p>While all metals are conductors, some are
better than others, the difference being in the
<b>resistance</b> that they offer. A comparison illustrating
resistance may be made between the
friction presented to the flow of water by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
small pipe and by a larger one, the water flowing
more easily through the latter than the former.
In flowing, the current must overcome the
resistance of the conductor, and in so doing
will lose part of its strength and will heat the
conductor, there being more loss of current and
greater heat as the resistance increases.</p>

<p>It is obvious that in order to obtain a current
of the greatest strength the conductor by which
it flows must present the least possible resistance,
and for this reason copper is used almost universally
to convey the current from one place to
another. A copper wire will carry safely a
current that would heat an iron wire of the
same size to the melting point. The resistance
of a small conductor is much greater than that
of a large one, so that the size of a conductor
must always be considered in relation to the
current that is to be conveyed.</p>

<p>A current of electricity may be measured,
just as water flowing through a pipe may be
measured, and by the same measurements
of pressure and volume. The pressure under
which the current flows is measured in <b>volts</b>, and
the quantity that passes in <b>amperes</b>; there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
also a term for resistance, that being measured
in <b>ohms</b>.</p>

<p>Because of the desire of the current to flow
from the positive to the negative pole, the circuit
must be so guarded that there may be no
leakage, for if it can return to the generator
without doing its work it will do so, taking any
path that offers less resistance to its passage.
Leakage is prevented by insulating the wires,
which may be done by wrapping them with
silk or cotton thread, or by coating them with
rubber. The wire by which the current flows
from the generator to its work is called the
<b>lead</b> (pronounced leed), and the conductor by
which it flows back, the <b>return</b>. The greatest
care must be taken that there is no leakage
from the lead wire in order that there may be
enough current to perform the work; but when
the current has done what was expected of it,
any conductor that does not present too much
resistance will serve to return it to its source.</p>

<p>While wire is sometimes used on ignition
circuits for the return as well as the lead, the
most usual method is to utilize the metal of
the engine to return the current to its source.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
The engine being made of iron, it is a conductor,
and while this metal is not so good a conductor
as copper, yet there is so much of it in an
engine that its resistance need not be considered.
This method is called <b>grounding the return</b>,
the term coming from telegraphy, in which
the dampness of the earth forms one of the
conductors.</p>

<p>A grounded circuit requires careful insulation
of the lead wire, for as it is very likely to
come into contact with the metal of the engine,
a break in the insulation would permit the
current to leak and to return to the generator
without doing its work, this condition being
called a <b>short circuit</b>. Grounding the circuit
saves wire and reduces complication; simplicity
is important in automobile work, and a reduction
of the parts much to be desired.</p>

<p>In the foregoing the word flow has been used
in describing the action of an electric current
in a wire, and there are so many points of
similarity with the flow of water in a pipe that
the term conveys a better idea than would
technical expressions. Electricity, however, has
neither substance nor weight, and cannot be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
said to flow or to move in the strict sense of the
words; but as flow is in general use, and is the
most descriptive of the commonly understood
words that are applied to it, it is made use of
here.</p>

<p>A current of electricity may be generated
either chemically or mechanically, and always
at the expense of something else. A chemical
generator produces a current at the expense of
a metal, usually zinc, which is eaten by the
chemicals in proportion to the amount of current
delivered; a mechanical generator produces
a current at the expense of the power that
drives it.</p>

<p>Chemical generators are of two kinds, <b>primary</b>
and <b>secondary</b> cells. While primary cells are
of many forms, that called the <b>dry cell</b> is universally
used for the ignition of automobile
engines, being adapted to the purpose because
there is nothing to spill, and may be used in
any position. It consists of a zinc cup lined
with some material of the nature of blotting
paper, in which, but not touching it, is a stick
of carbon, the space between being filled with
absorbent material and broken bits of carbon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
moistened with the proper chemical solution.
The top of the cell is sealed to prevent evaporation,
and thumb nuts on the projecting end of
the carbon stick and the zinc cup form the
terminals to which the wires are attached.
The carbon being the positive pole and the zinc
the negative, the current flows in that direction
whenever a circuit is provided.</p>

<p>The dry cell gives a current at a pressure of
about one and a half volts when new, the voltage
dropping as the cell is used until it is exhausted,
when the trifling cost of a new cell should not
be considered in replacing it.</p>

<p>A better source of current than the dry cell
is the secondary or <b>storage cell</b>, which is a
reservoir rather than a generator. When a
current of electricity is passed to it, usually
from a lighting circuit, a chemical change takes
place, the action being called the charging of
the cell. When the change is complete, the
cell is disconnected, and will then deliver a
current because the parts of the cell that underwent
a chemical change tend to return to their
previous condition. The current that it gives
off is practically equal to that by which it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
charged, and may be used steadily or intermittently
until the cell is exhausted. It is
made of prepared lead plates, which are placed
in a hard-rubber or celluloid jar, with a cover
to prevent the spilling of the solution with
which the plates are covered.</p>

<p>The charging of storage cells must be done
by an expert, for mishandling will ruin them,
and it is far better to put this matter, as well
as repairs, in the hands of a man who knows
his business than to attempt it without the
proper knowledge and appliances.</p>

<p>One point that the automobilist must watch,
however, is the position and quality of the
solution in the cells, called the <b>electrolyte</b>.
The cells should always be full enough to have
the plates well covered, and any loss by leakage
or splashing should be made up, for the plates
must not be exposed to the air.</p>

<p>Electrolyte is made by adding one part of
chemically pure sulphuric acid to from three
to four parts of distilled or rain water, adding
the acid slowly and stirring constantly. The
combination of acid and water generates heat,
and care must be taken not to pour the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
into the acid, for the generation of heat would
then be so sudden that the mixture would boil
and splash, burning whatever it touched. By
means of an instrument called a <b>hydrometer</b>,
the density of the mixture may be ascertained,
and when the proportions are correct the scale
should read 1,200. Hydrometers are made with
the instrument inside of a glass tube, one end of
which has a spout, the other being fitted with
a rubber bulb. By inserting the spout in the
vent hole of the cell cover, the tube may be
filled with electrolyte, the hydrometer showing
whether or not it is of the correct density.</p>

<p>The cells should be tested every little while,
and if the density is not correct acid or water
should be added to make it so. Never probe
inside of the cells with anything but a glass
or hard-rubber rod, for metal would cause a
short circuit between the two plates it touched,
and probably ruin the cell.</p>

<p>The terminals of a storage cell are marked in
order to distinguish them, the symbols being
the plus (+) sign for the positive pole and
minus (-) for the negative, these being universally
used in this way on all electrical work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
In some makes of storage cells the positive
pole in addition is painted red and the negative
black.</p>

<p>A storage cell when fully charged gives a
current at a pressure of about two and a half
volts; the voltage drops as the cell is used, and
when it gets down to 1. 8 volts it must be recharged.
When a storage cell is discharged,
it should be recharged immediately, for otherwise
it will deteriorate.</p>

<p>One dry or storage cell does not give a sufficient
current to supply the required spark, and
several must therefore be used. The most
usual method of connecting dry cells, and the
only method of connecting storage cells, to
form a battery, is to connect the negative pole
of the first cell to the positive pole of the
second, using a short length of insulated wire
of sufficient size, the negative of the second to
the positive of the third, and so on, until all of
the cells necessary to supply the required current
are used. This leaves the positive pole of
the first cell and the negative pole of the last
cell free to be connected into the circuit. The
current obtained will have a pressure that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
as much greater than the pressure of one cell
as there are cells in the battery; for instance,
if there are four cells in the battery, of one
and a half volts each, the voltage of the battery
will be six volts. This method is called
connecting in <b>series</b> (Fig. 24).</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image085" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image085.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.—Battery Connections.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>When the voltage of one cell is sufficient,
and it is desired to increase the volume, or
amperage, of the current, the cells may be
connected in <b>parallel</b>, which is done by connecting
together all of the negative poles by one
wire, and all of the positive poles by another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
the two wires leading to the circuit. This increases
the amperage as many times as there
are cells.</p>

<p>If it is desired to connect the cells so that
both the voltage and amperage are increased,
the cells may be divided into two or more
groups, with the same number of cells in each.
The cells of each group are connected in series,
and the free poles of the groups connected in
parallel, which is called connecting in <b>series-multiple</b>
(Fig. 24). This is a most satisfactory
method of connecting the cells for an ignition
circuit, for it gives a uniform current, and increases
the life of the cells. The voltage of the
current is equal to the voltage of one cell multiplied
by the number of cells in one group,
and the amperage that of one cell multiplied
by the number of groups.</p>

<p>The action of a mechanical generator, which
when driven produces a current of electricity, is
due to magnetism, that being understood to
be the power sometimes possessed by iron or
steel to attract other pieces of iron or steel.
Magnetism may be manifested either by permanent
or electro-magnets. If a piece of steel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
is magnetized—that is, made a magnet—it continues
to be a magnet, for steel retains that
property, while iron does not. A magnet made
of steel is called a <b>permanent magnet</b>.</p>

<p>If a piece of iron is wound with insulated
wire through which an electric current passes,
the iron will become a magnet, and will remain
so as long as the current flows. This is called
an <b>electro-magnet</b>.</p>

<p>The two ends of a magnet are the positive
and negative poles, and the positive pole of
one magnet will repel the positive pole and
attract the negative pole of another magnet.
Between the two poles of a magnet there is a
constant flow of what are known as <b>magnetic
lines of force</b>, which may be made visible by
laying a piece of paper over the two poles and
scattering iron filings on it. The filings will
form into curves from one pole to the other,
showing the presence of these lines.</p>

<p>If a wire is moved across these lines of force,
so that it cuts them, a current of electricity
will be set up in it, and if the wire is wound into
a coil and moved across the lines, the current
will be as much stronger as there are turns of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
wire cutting them. A mechanical generator
consists of a coil of insulated wire, arranged
so that as it revolves in the <b>magnetic field</b> each
turn of wire cuts across the lines of magnetic
force.</p>

<p>The magnet producing the lines of force that
compose the magnetic field is called the <b>field</b>,
and the revolving coil of wire the <b>armature</b>.</p>

<p>Mechanical generators for producing the
current for an ignition circuit are of two types,
<b>magnetos</b> and <b>dynamos</b>, the former being in
much more general use than the latter. In a
magneto the field is a permanent magnet, and
in a dynamo it is an electro-magnet. The
magnets forming the field of a magneto are
bent into horseshoe shape, so that the poles
are close together, and the armature revolves
between them. The field of a dynamo is of
similar shape, wound with insulated wire,
the current that flows through it being generated
by the dynamo itself; the field is
strongly magnetized only when the dynamo is
running.</p>

<p>The armature of either type is a piece of soft
iron, with grooves cut in it lengthways, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the wire is wound; the winding thus being
contrary to that of thread on a spool. The
current generated in the wire of the armature
is taken off by means of <b>brushes</b>, and connection
is made through binding posts set in the
base.</p>

<p>As the care of a mechanical generator requires
a knowledge of electrical engineering, it is better
to return it to the makers in case of injury,
rather than to attempt to repair it without the
necessary experience. (See Appendix.)</p>

<p>Practically all ignition circuits are provided
with two sources of current, so that in case of
the failure of one the other will be available,
and either may be connected into the circuit
by means of a <b>switch</b>. The simplest form of
switch is a piece of flat spring brass, pivoted at
one end so that the other may be swung from
side to side to make contact with one or the
other of two brass knobs, or <b>switch points</b>.
One pole of each generator, usually the negative,
is grounded, and the other connected to
one of the points. The flat spring, or <b>switch
blade</b>, is connected to the ignition circuit, so
that when it is in contact with one of the points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the corresponding source is called on to supply
the current. The blade may rest between the
points, not touching either, in which case the
circuit is broken, and no current flows.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">While there are various methods by
which an electric spark may be produced,
but two are in use for automobile
work, one being the <b>high-tension</b> or
<b>jump-spark system</b>, and the other the <b>low-tension</b>
or <b>make-and-break system</b>. The difference
between these is in the pressure of the
current, which in the first is great enough to
enable it to jump from one terminal to another
a short distance away, forming a spark as it
passes. The pressure of the current of the low-tension
system is not sufficient to permit it to
do this, but when two terminals of the system
are brought into contact so that the current may
flow, a spark will form as they are separated.</p>


<h3>MAKE-AND-BREAK SYSTEM</h3>

<p>In the make-and-break system, the <b>igniter</b>,
which is the device in the combustion space at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
which the spark occurs, is made with two metal
points, one of which is stationary and the other
movable, the latter being acted on by a cam,
through a <b>tappet</b>. As the cam revolves, the
tappet is lifted and the movable point brought
into contact with the stationary; when the
nose of the cam passes from under the tappet,
the movable point is snapped away from the
stationary through the action of a spring
(Fig. 25). These points
are so connected into
the circuit that when
they are in contact the
current flows, the circuit
being broken when
they separate. Shortly
before the spark is desired
the movable point
is brought into contact with the other so that
the circuit is completed and the current flows,
and they are separated at the instant when the
spark is required to ignite the mixture, this
occurring as they separate and break the
circuit.</p>

</div>

<p>The current that is supplied by the battery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
is not capable of producing this spark, for it
flows with large volume and small pressure—i.e.,
high amperage and low voltage—and it is necessary
to transform it to a current of higher voltage
and lower amperage, which is done by
means of a <b>primary induction coil</b>. A coil of
this description consists of a <b>core</b> made of a
bundle of soft iron wires, around which is the
<b>primary winding</b>, formed by winding several
layers of insulated copper wire on it. The
core becomes a magnet when a current of
electricity flows through the winding, and
ceases to be a magnet when the flow ceases,
the magnetization occurring slowly on the
completion of the circuit, and demagnetization
instantly on the breaking of the circuit.</p>

<p>The influence of a magnet, as, for instance, its
attraction for a piece of iron, is felt throughout
a field the extent of which depends on the
strength of the magnetization. When a loop
of wire forming a closed circuit is placed in the
<b>magnetic field</b>, a current of electricity will be
set up in it whenever the strength of the field
changes. If the strength of the field does not
change, no current will be set up; but the greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
the change in strength, whether from strong to
weak or from weak to strong, the greater will
be the strength of the current. This principle
is applied in the case of a coil, for the wire that
forms the winding is in the magnetic field of the
core, and a current is set up in it whenever the
strength of the field changes. The strongest
current will be set up, or <b>induced</b>, when the
strength of the field changes from no magnetism
to a degree when the core is magnetized to its
fullest capacity or the reverse, and when the
change occurs in the least possible time. The
current that is set up will last only during
the time when the change in strength occurs,
ceasing to exist when the strength of the field is
uniformly strong or weak. The more rapid the
change, the greater will be the pressure of the
current, but the shorter the period of its existence.</p>

<p>It is this induced current that forms the spark
in the combustion space, the battery current
serving only to establish the condition that will
produce it. When the two points of the igniter
come into contact and complete the circuit,
the flow of the battery current through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
winding of the coil will gradually magnetize the
core, and on the igniter points being separated,
this flow through the winding will cease, the
strength of the magnetic field dropping instantly
from full intensity to practically nothing. This
change induces a powerful current in the winding,
which current in passing over the circuit
causes a spark between the points of the igniter
as they separate. The induced current is set
up so instantaneously on the breaking of the
battery circuit that the spark is usually considered
as being that of the battery current,
but, as stated, the battery current serves only
to magnetize the core, the spark resulting from
the current induced by its demagnetization on
the breaking of the circuit.</p>

<p>A magneto is a machine that when driven
generates an electric current, and is in almost
universal use for this system of ignition. In
many cars the system is so arranged that the
driver has his choice between ignition by battery
and coil, as described, and ignition by
magneto, but the mechanical production of a
current is so reliable that many automobile
builders rely on the magneto alone. Magnetos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
of the type used for ignition are described
in the appendix.</p>


<h3>JUMP-SPARK SYSTEM</h3>

<p>The jump-spark or high-tension system of
ignition depends on the production of a current
at such a pressure that it can jump from one
point to another through high resistance, such
as is presented by air at ordinary or low temperature,
and especially when compressed, the
spark occurring as it passes.</p>

<p>This high pressure is obtained through the
use of a <b>secondary induction coil</b>, which consists
of a core and primary winding similar to those
of the primary induction coil already described,
and in addition has a <b>secondary winding</b>,
formed by a great length of insulated copper
wire, which to save bulk and weight is very
fine, wound over the primary winding. The
change in the strength of the magnetic field
produced by the core affects this secondary
winding, just as it affects the primary winding;
that is, a current is set up in it at every change
in the strength of the magnetic field, the pressure
of the current depending on the greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
or less extent of the change, and the rapidity
with which it occurs. The magnetization of the
core takes place but slowly, for the particles
of iron must absorb it one from the other, but
the demagnetization occurs instantly; the current
that is induced during the demagnetization
is therefore the greater, and is the current
that has sufficient pressure to jump across the
gap.</p>

<p>The ignition system employing this coil consists
of two distinct parts: the <b>primary circuit</b>,
which magnetizes the core, and the <b>secondary
circuit</b>, which leads to the combustion space
the current that is induced in the secondary
winding.</p>

<p>The primary circuit includes the battery or
generator that supplies the current, the primary
winding of the coil, a <b>timer</b>, and a <b>vibrator</b>.</p>


<h3>THE TIMER</h3>

<p>The spark must occur in the combustion
space only at the instant when the mixture is
in a condition to be ignited, and it is obvious
that only then is the secondary current required.
As the secondary current results from the flow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
of the primary current through the primary
winding, a device must be included in the
primary circuit to permit the current to flow
and magnetize the core at this instant. This
device is called a <b>timer</b>, or <b>commutator</b>, and is
nothing more than a revolving switch operated
by the engine, that completes the primary
circuit at such times as the secondary current
is required, and breaks the circuit when the
secondary current has done its work in the
production of the spark. Because ignition
occurs but once in each cylinder during two
revolutions of the crank shaft, the timer completes
the circuit but once in that interval, and
is placed on the half-time shaft that operates
the exhaust valves. In its simplest form, a
timer consists of a disk of hard rubber, wood
fiber, or other insulating material in which is
set a metal plate, mounted on the half-time
shaft and revolving with it. A flat spring
carried on a plate of hard insulating material
bears against the edge of the disk, and during
one revolution of the latter the metal plate set
in it will be brought into contact with the spring
(Fig. 26, first diagram). If one wire of the primary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
circuit is connected to the metal plate of
the disk and the other wire to the spring, it will
be seen that the circuit will be complete when
the revolution of the disk brings the two together,
and broken when the further revolution of the
disk separates them.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image099" style="max-width: 60.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image099.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 26.—Types of Timers.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>There is a great variety in the methods by
which this result is secured, the chief essential
being that the contact must be made as positively
as possible in order that the resistance
to the current in passing from one part of the
timer to the other may be as low as possible,
and broken equally positively. The number
of contacts that the timer makes during one
revolution depends on the number of cylinders
of the engine, the revolving part touching two,
three, four, or more springs or contact points
on the stationary part as it turns. A timer
for a two-cylinder engine is shown in the second
diagram on Fig. 26, the third diagram being
of a form of timer in which the revolving part
is not connected into the circuit, but serves to
bring together a spring and a contact point,
the circuit being completed when they touch.
A modern form of timer consists of a ring of
hard rubber on the inside face of which are set
the metal plates, while the moving part revolves
within it, and may be a flat spring, or a plunger,
or a roller, contact being maintained by a coil
spring. The difficulty of attaching a wire to
the moving part of the timer is overcome by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
having its contact in connection with the half-time
shaft, the current flowing from the contact
on the stationary part to that on the moving
part, and from there flowing by the half-time
shaft to the ground connection of the battery,
for, as all parts are of metal, the current can
pass from the shaft to the ground connection
through the bearings and the engine.</p>

<p>If the spark were always required to pass in
the combustion space at the same point in the
stroke of the piston, this could be secured by
setting the stationary part of the timer in such
relation to the moving part that contact would
be made when the half-time shaft reached any
desired point in its revolution. As it is necessary
to change the point at which ignition
occurs, however, the timer must be so arranged
that it closes the circuit earlier or later, according
to conditions. To effect this, the stationary
part of the timer is so made that it
may rotate around the shaft for about a half
turn, and it is controlled by a lever on the
steering column, which holds it in any desired
position. If the stationary part is rotated in
the direction opposite to that in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
half-time shaft revolves, contact will be made
and the circuit closed at an earlier point in its
revolution than if it is rotated in the same
direction. It must be remembered that the
revolution of the half-time shaft, in operating
the exhaust valve, revolves exactly in accordance
with the crank shaft and the movement of
the piston, and that as the moving part of the
timer is attached to it, contact can be made
at any desired point in the stroke of the piston
by the position in which the stationary part is
placed.</p>


<h3>THE VIBRATOR</h3>

<p>The secondary current occurs whenever the
core is magnetized and demagnetized, and it
is clear that the oftener the magnetization occurs
the more constant will be its presence.
The timer closes and opens the primary circuit,
which results in the production of but two impulses
of the secondary current, and as these
are not sufficient to produce the necessary
spark, additional means are employed to make
and break the circuit while the timer makes
contact. This is accomplished by means of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
<b>vibrator</b>, or <b>trembler</b>, which consists of a flat
steel spring secured at one end, so that it may
vibrate after the manner of a tuning fork.
About midway between its ends the point of
an <b>adjusting screw</b> touches it, and when the
flat spring, or <b>blade</b>, vibrates, it springs away
from this screw and returns to it, both screw
and blade being tipped with platinum to offset
corrosion. If one wire of the circuit is attached
to the blade and the other to the screw, the
circuit will be complete when the blade touches
the screw, and broken when it springs away
from it. In the early type of vibrator the
blade was set in vibration by mechanical means.
At the end of the blade was a weight, which
rested on the edge of a cam, the blade then
being out of contact with the adjusting screw
(Fig. 27). During the revolution of the cam the
weight dropped into a deep notch, thus setting
the blade into vibration and the circuit being
made and broken. This type has been almost
entirely superseded by the <b>magnetic vibrator</b>,
which is more rapid and accurate. In this
the blade is so placed that its free end is close
to the end of the core of the coil (Fig. 28). When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
the timer makes contact and the current passes
through the primary winding, the core becomes
magnetized and attracts to it the free end of
the steel blade, this movement drawing the
blade away from the adjusting screw with which
it was in contact. The vibrator is so connected
into the primary circuit that the current flows
from the battery to the adjusting screw, thence
to the blade and through the primary winding;
when the attraction of the blade by the core<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
draws it away from the adjusting screw, the
circuit is broken, and the magnetism then
ceasing to exist, the elasticity of the blade
causes it to spring back to the screw, to make
contact, and to be again attracted by the magnetism.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>This action continues as long as the timer
holds the circuit closed, and a wave of secondary
current is set up in the secondary winding
for every make and break that results. By
means of the adjusting screw, the vibrations
may be made long and slow, or short and quick,
with a corresponding difference in the secondary
current. As the object to be attained is the
production of a spark that will ignite the mixture
rapidly, the vibrator must be adjusted
with this end in view; but it is also advisable to
obtain the spark with the least possible expenditure
of current, and with the least wear
of the parts. The passing of the battery current
through the primary winding establishes the
condition that exists in the make-and-break
ignition system, and the demagnetization of
the core will set up an induced current that will
result in a spark at the points where the circuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
is broken; that is, at the vibrator and timer
contacts. This spark can be greatly overcome
in the timer by packing it with vaseline, which,
being an insulator, breaks down the spark in
flowing between the contacts of the stationary
and moving parts as they separate. If the
vibrator contacts presented no resistance—an
impossible condition—there would be no
spark, but as they will always be slightly
burned and corroded, the spark must be kept
as small as the requirements of the secondary
current will justify by the adjustment of the
screw. In other words, adjust the vibrator so
that it gives the best results in the production
of the secondary spark with as little sparking
as possible at the vibrator contacts.</p>


<h3>THE SPARK PLUG</h3>

<p>The secondary circuit includes the secondary
winding of the coil and the <b>spark plug</b>, which
is the device in the combustion space at which
the spark occurs. The spark plug provides
two points of metal at a fixed distance apart,
which are so connected into the circuit that
the current must jump from one to the other in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
order to complete its circuit. The secondary
current, as well as the primary, may make use
of the metal of the engine as a ground return,
and one of the points of the spark plug is therefore
in contact with the metal, being supported
on a metal sleeve that is screwed into the cylinder.
The other point must of course be insulated
from it, for if it were not the current
could pass from one to the other without jumping
the space between them. The insulation
is secured by a tube of porcelain or mica set in
the sleeve, the lower end of a metal rod that
passes through it being the required distance
from the wire or projection on the sleeve (Fig.
29). This device must be strong enough to
resist the pressure in the combustion space
during the compression and power strokes,
and must be unaffected by the intense heat.</p>

<h3>THE CIRCUIT</h3>

<p>Fig. 30 shows the primary and secondary
circuits of the jump-spark system, as applied to
a one-cylinder engine, the light lines representing
the primary circuit and the heavy lines the
secondary. Each circuit forms a complete
path by which the current passing over it may
return to the point at which it started. In
practice the wiring is simplified by the use of
but one ground return for both circuits, the
primary and secondary windings of the coil
being connected at one point, and the secondary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
current returning either through the timer as
it makes contact or through the battery.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.—Ignition Circuit.</span> Wiring diagram for one-cylinder
engine, with coil, timer, and two batteries; coil with magnetic
vibrator.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The flow of the primary circuit is from the
battery to the switch, to the vibrator, which
is built into the coil, through the primary
winding and the timer contacts, whence it
passes by the metal of the engine and ground
wire back to the battery. The secondary circuit
consists of a wire from the secondary winding
of the coil to the spark plug, and back to
its winding by the metal of the engine and a
ground wire, which, as has been explained, may
be the separate ground wire shown in the
diagram, or the return that is common to both
circuits.</p>

<p>The timer makes contact as the half-time
shaft revolves, and the vibrator operates as
long as the circuit is closed; while this occurs,
the secondary current is set up, and the spark
passes.</p>

<p>Included in the primary circuit and built into
the base of the coil is a <b>condenser</b> which, while
of such delicate construction that it is most
inadvisable for the automobilist to attempt to
examine or repair it, is of such advantage that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
it should be understood. A current flowing in
a circuit possesses momentum, and if the circuit
is broken, the momentum will cause the
current to flow across the break for a greater
or less time, according to the pressure. This
will produce a spark, and a spark at the vibrator
as it breaks the circuit will not only burn away
the contacts, but will prevent the instant demagnetization
of the core. The passing of a
spark between the vibrator contacts indicates
that the current is still flowing through the
primary winding, and that the core is still magnetized.
The function of the condenser is to
prevent sparking at the vibrator by absorbing
the momentum of the current, and, what is more
important, to cause the instant demagnetization
of the core by the instant breaking of the circuit.</p>

<p>While it is usual to provide a multicylinder
engine with one coil for each cylinder, it is
possible to equip it with but one, in such a case
a <b>secondary distributer</b> being used. This consists
of two parts: a primary timer, and a somewhat
similar device by which the secondary
current induced in the coil is switched from
cylinder to cylinder as it is required. For a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
four-cylinder engine the timer has four contacts,
as in the usual type; but the primary
winding is connected to all of them, so that as
the moving part of the timer revolves, the core
of the single coil is magnetized four times to
two revolutions of the crank shaft. A single
wire leads the secondary current that is thus
induced to the distributer, by which it is
switched to the several cylinders. The moving
part of the distributer rotates in unison with
the moving part of the timer, making contact
as it does so with contact pieces, each of which
is connected to one of the spark plugs.</p>

<p>When the timer makes its contact the distributer
is in position to pass the induced current
to the proper cylinder, the connections being
made in accordance with the firing order of the
engine. While this system has advantages in
that there is but one vibrator to adjust, the
fact that the coil is operating for the greater
part of the time makes it more liable to injury
through heating and the consequent breaking
down of its insulation.</p>

<span class="fs80">TRANSMISSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The <b>transmission</b> of an automobile consists
of those parts that transmit to
the driving wheels the power developed
by the engine.</p>


<h3>THE CLUTCH</h3>

<p>Because a gasoline engine must be in operation
before it can deliver power, a <b>clutch</b> is
provided by means of which it may run free or
be so connected that it drives the car, one of its
two chief parts being attached to the engine
and the other to the transmission. When the
two parts are in contact, the transmission is
driven, and when separated, the engine and
transmission are independent of each other, and
may be stationary or in motion. A clutch
must be of such a nature that it does not apply
the power of the engine instantly, but gradually,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
so that the car starts slowly and without jerking.
If the power were to be applied suddenly, the
effort of starting the stationary car would
either overcome the momentum of the engine
and stop it, or would jerk the car into such
sudden motion that it might be badly wrenched.
By making the clutch so that it is permitted
to slip when first applied, the part that is
driven is gradually brought to the speed of the
part that drives, when slipping ceases and the
two make firm contact.</p>

<p>The most usual form of clutch is the <b>friction
cone</b>, in which the fly wheel of the engine is
utilized as the driving part, the rim being
broad and thick, with its inner side funnel-shaped,
or beveled. A metal <b>cone</b> that fits the
bevel is carried on the end of a shaft of the
transmission, the shaft at this point being
square, to fit a square hole in the hub of the
cone. This arrangement permits the cone to
slide along the shaft while always revolving
with it. When the cone is pressed to a seat
in the fly wheel, which is accomplished by
means of a heavy coil spring, the friction between
its leather-covered surface and the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
of the fly wheel causes the two parts to revolve
together, and by its fit on the square shaft
the transmission is set in motion, and through
that the car. The clutch is thrown out of
contact by means of a foot pedal that acts on
a ring fitting in a groove around the hub of
the cone; when the pedal is released, the spring
forces the cone to its seat (Fig. 31). In order
to support it, the end of the shaft carrying the
cone projects into the hub of the fly wheel,
where it rests in a bearing, this arrangement
in no manner preventing the two parts from
acting independently of each other.</p>

<p>In the <b>reversed type</b> of friction-cone clutch a
funnel-shaped ring is bolted to the rim of the
fly wheel and forms the seat, the cone fitting
inside of it (Fig. 31). Depressing the pedal
moves the cone toward the fly wheel instead
of away from it, as in the regular type, and
while there is no difference in the effect of one
as against the other, the reversed type is more
compact.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 31.—Friction Cone Clutches.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The <b>multiple-disk clutch</b>, which is rapidly
coming into use, depends on the friction between
the flat surfaces of metal when pressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>together. An experiment illustrating this is to
place a silver dollar between two half dollars,
and to press them together between the thumb
and finger. It will be found that a light
pressure is sufficient to produce friction that
will make it difficult to revolve the large coin
between the smaller ones.</p>

<p>The parts of a simple form of multiple-disk
clutch, as shown in Fig. 32, are a <b>flange</b> on the
engine shaft, a smaller flange with a square-hole,
square-shaft arrangement on the transmission
shaft, and large and small <b>rings</b> placed
alternately. The large rings are driven by the
large flange, fitting loosely on pins, or <b>studs</b>,
projecting from it, and the small rings are similarly
attached to the transmission shaft. The
openings in the large or driving rings are large
enough to contain the studs carrying the small
rings, so that when the parts are assembled
the outer surfaces of the small or driven rings
are in contact with the inner surfaces of the
driving rings. A heavy coil spring is arranged
to press the small flange toward the flange on
the engine shaft, binding the rings that it carries
between the driving rings, and the latter are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
often faced with leather to increase the friction
between them. When the small flange is released
from the pressure of the spring by depressing
the pedal, the driving and driven
flanges with their rings are independent of each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
other, and the engine may run free while the
transmission shaft is stationary or revolving.
A clutch of this type is incased and runs in
oil, which prevents the rings from gripping
suddenly; when the pressure of the spring is
applied, the oil is gradually squeezed out from
between them, and the slipping of the driving
and driven rings is reduced as they are forced
into contact.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.—Multiple Disk Clutch.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>An <b>internal-expanding</b> clutch consists of a
broad ring, or <b>drum</b>, against the inner surface
of which bear two pieces of metal shaped to
fit. The pieces of metal, or <b>shoes</b>, are pivoted
together at one end so that they may be moved
in or out, after the manner of the handles of a
pair of scissors; when open they bear against
the inside surface of the drum, and when closed
they are free from it. The drum is attached
to the engine shaft and the shoes to the transmission
shaft, the friction between them being
so great that the transmission shaft is carried
around as the drum revolves. The shoes are
kept in contact with the drum by a coil spring,
the depression of a pedal releasing them from
its pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>


<h3>CHANGE-SPEED MECHANISM</h3>

<p>The <b>change-speed mechanism</b>, to which the
clutch transmits the power of the engine, is to
the engine what a block and tackle is to a man
who lifts a heavy weight, and is necessary
because of the varying resistance to the movement
of the car in traversing steep, rough hills
and smooth avenues. A change-speed mechanism
may be defined as an arrangement by which
the relative number of revolutions of the crank
shaft and driving wheels may be altered to suit
conditions. If the driving wheels revolve but
once while the crank shaft makes twelve revolutions,
the car will move at one sixth the
speed that it would have if the wheels revolved
once to every two revolutions of the crank
shaft, but it will have six times the ability to
overcome the resistance presented by a hill or
sandy road.</p>

<p>If a gasoline engine were so connected that
the relative number of revolutions of the crank
shaft and wheels could not be changed, a slowing
down of the car through the resistance presented
by a rough hill would slow the engine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
to correspond, and as speed is an important
factor in the power that the engine delivers, it
would be prevented from doing the work of
which it is capable at the time when it was most
necessary. By means of the change-speed
mechanisms in most general use, the relative
number of revolutions of the crank shaft to
one of the wheels may be varied to from two
to eighteen, the former giving the car high speed
over a smooth road, and the latter slow speed,
but greater ability to overcome hills and heavy
roads.</p>

<p>To attain this result, gears are used. If two
gears having the same number of teeth are in
mesh, they will make the same number of
revolutions, and the force with which the driven
gear will revolve will be the same as that of
the driving gear, less the friction of the teeth.
If the driven gear has twice the number of
teeth of the driving gear, it will revolve at half
the speed, but with twice the force.</p>

<p>The forms of change-speed mechanism most
largely used are based on this principle, which
is so applied that the gear driven by the engine
may be in mesh with a gear that has many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
more teeth and revolves much slower in consequence,
or a gear that has possibly one and
a half times the number of teeth, or a gear that
has the same number of teeth, and therefore
revolves at the same speed. The <b>sliding-gear</b>
mechanism takes its name from the arrangement
by which the changes in the combination
of gears is effected by sliding them along a
shaft, to mesh with other gears on a shaft driven
by the engine.</p>

<p>The driver changes the gears by moving a
lever that in the <b>progressive type</b> moves forward
by degrees to move the car on the slow speed,
the intermediate speeds, and the high. A
typical arrangement of the progressive type of
sliding change-speed mechanism is shown in
Fig. 33. The power of the engine is transmitted
to a short, hollow shaft, called a <b>sleeve</b> (<em>A</em>),
which carries a gear (<em>B</em>) that is in permanent
mesh with a gear (<em>C</em>) on the end of the <b>countershaft</b>.
Parallel to the countershaft is another
shaft, one end of which is held in a bearing
in the hollow sleeve; while the sleeve supports
this shaft, the two may revolve independently
of each other. The second shaft is square,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>or of such a construction that while the two
gears that it carries may slide along, they revolve
with it. The gears on the square shaft
are of different sizes, and in sliding on it come
successively into mesh with gears carried on
the countershaft. Because of the gears between
them, the countershaft revolves when
the engine revolves the sleeve; but the speed of
the square shaft depends on the combination
of gears in mesh between it and the countershaft.
When the sliding gears are in such a
position that they are not in mesh with the
countershaft gears, the square shaft is independent
of the countershaft, and may revolve
or be stationary, the gears then being in the
<b>neutral position</b>. When the sliding part is
moved so that its largest gear is in mesh with
the smallest of the countershaft gears (<em>D</em>),
the square shaft will revolve at a slower speed
than the countershaft, because its gear is
larger than the one driving it. Again sliding
the moving part will separate these gears,
and bring the next pair (<em>E</em>) into mesh, the
square shaft then moving at a higher speed,
but still slower than the countershaft because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
of the difference in the size of the gears. Sliding
the moving part still farther along the shaft
will disengage the <b>second-speed</b> gears and engage
the <b>high speed</b>, in which the square shaft revolves
at the speed of the sleeve and crank shaft,
this being effected by locking the moving part
to the sleeve by means of a clutch (<em>G</em>). This
clutch consists of several fingers projecting
from the moving part, corresponding to the
spaces between similar fingers on the end of
the sleeve. The locking together of the square
shaft and sleeve gives what is known as the
<b>direct drive</b>, which is of comparatively recent
development; many designs of sliding gears
still use a third pair of gears which, being of
the same size, give the square shaft the speed
of the crank shaft. By the use of the direct
drive, the power of the engine is directly applied
to the square shaft, avoiding the loss that
occurs through the friction of the teeth of the
gears.</p>

<p>The revolution of the square shaft is transmitted
to the driving wheels, the speed of the
car therefore corresponding to the speed at
which the square shaft is driven by the gear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
combinations between it and the countershaft.
To obtain the <b>reverse</b>, which enables the car
to be backed without reversing the engine, a
third gear is introduced between the low-speed
gears of the square shaft and countershaft.
When two gears are in mesh, they revolve in
opposite directions, but when one of them is
in addition meshed with a third gear, the first
and third will revolve in the same direction, and
opposite to the direction in which the middle
gear revolves. When the car is going forward,
the square shaft and countershaft revolve in
opposite directions, but when the reverse gear is
introduced between them, the square shaft is
revolved in the same direction as the countershaft,
reversing the rotation of the driving
wheels.</p>

<p>The ends of the teeth of the gears are chisel-shaped,
instead of being flat, as in ordinary
gears, so that they will go into mesh easily.</p>

<p>The greatest economy in the operation of a
gasoline engine results from its running at as
nearly constant a speed as possible, and the
gear is therefore changed when the resistance
of the road to the movement of the car decreases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
the speed of the engine, or permits it to
increase.</p>

<p>The <b>selective type</b> of sliding change-speed
mechanism as shown on Fig. 34 is in use on
many of the high-grade cars, and its control
differs from that of the progressive type described
in that the lever has only a short movement
forward and back, and in addition may
slide sideways. To the lower end of the lever
is attached a shaft that rocks in its bearings
as the lever is moved forward or back, and
slides lengthways when the lever is moved
toward or away from the car.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the countershaft and
square shaft is the same as in the progressive
type, but there are two sets of sliding gears
instead of one, and these are moved by means
of arms that extend from rods sliding in bearings
at the side of the gear case. When these
rods are slid endways, the gears attached to
their arms slide on the square shaft to correspond,
and go in or out of mesh with the countershaft
gears. Across the ends of these rods are
grooves, which when the gears are in the neutral
position are in line with the rocking shaft attached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>to the control lever. From the inward
end of the rocking shaft a finger (<em>L</em>) projects
downward into the groove; when the grooves
are in line, the rocking shaft may be slid endways,
the finger passing from one groove to
the next without affecting the rods. When
the shaft is rocked, however, the finger in engaging
one of the grooves slides the rod endways,
shifting the gears controlled by its arm. Moving
the control lever into such a position that it
may enter the middle slots of the guide plate (<em>M</em>)
slides the rocking shaft so that its finger projects
into the groove of the central sliding
rod (<em>J</em>), and if the control lever is then pushed
forward so that it enters the front half of the
slot, the sliding rod will be moved by the
finger in the opposite direction, and the low-speed
gears (<em>D</em>) will be brought into mesh.
Bringing the lever back to the central position
will separate the gears, and moving it to the
back half of the slot will slide the same gears
in the opposite direction, meshing the second-speed
combination (<em>E</em>). Moving the control
lever outward so that it is in line with the outside
slot brings the finger into the groove of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
the sliding rod (<em>H</em>) that moves the third and
high speeds (<em>F</em> and <em>G</em>), the latter being direct
drive, and the reverse is obtained through the
movement of the sliding rod (<em>K</em>) that is engaged
by the finger when the control lever is in the
inside slot. The movement of this rod brings
a third gear (<em>O</em>) into mesh with the low-speed
gears on the square shaft and countershaft,
and the rotation of the countershaft is reversed.</p>

<p>While this type is in general use, the gears
are often so arranged that the direct drive
combination is reached when the control lever
is in the third-speed position, the gears meshed
by the fourth-speed position driving the square
shaft at a still higher speed. This high speed
can only be used for running under the best
road conditions.</p>

<p>The advantages of the selective type over the
progressive are the shorter movements of the
control lever and the ability to pass from one
speed to any other without the necessity of first
meshing and unmeshing those between, or, in
other words, there is a neutral position between
every combination of gears, and from neutral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
any desired combination may be obtained
directly without reference to the others.</p>

<p>In starting up a car fitted with either of these
types of change-speed mechanism, it is necessary
to withdraw the clutch before sliding the gears,
and this is also necessary in changing from one
combination to another. The square or corresponding
shaft of a change-speed mechanism
is always connected with the driving wheels,
and is at rest when the car is standing. With
the engine running, the countershaft will be
revolving, and it will obviously be difficult to
slide the stationary gear into mesh with a gear
that is revolving. When the clutch is withdrawn,
the countershaft moves only through
momentum, and will be brought to a stop by
the contact of the teeth of the sliding gear as
that is moved against it, the two then easily
going into mesh. The clutch is then thrown
in slowly, and will bring the speed of the countershaft
to the speed of the crank shaft.</p>

<p>When the car is moving, sliding the gears
without first withdrawing the clutch will bring
together two gears that are revolving at different
speeds, and as it is necessary for them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
to be rotating equally in order that they
may mesh, either the speed of the car must be
changed to bring the speed of the gear on the
square shaft to that of the countershaft gear,
or the speed of the engine must be changed
to bring the countershaft gear to the speed of
the gear on the square shaft. If the change is
from a low to a higher speed, the countershaft
will be moving much faster than the square
shaft, and their gears being brought into contact
will result in the slowing of one and speeding
up of the other until the speeds are the
same, but in so doing the ends of the teeth will
grind against each other, resulting in the wear
of the chisel-pointed ends, if not in the breaking
of the teeth. Withdrawing the clutch obviates
this difficulty, for it frees the countershaft,
permitting its gear to take the speed of the
square-shaft gear without wear or damage,
and when the change is made, the slow engagement
of the clutch brings the speed of both to
that required by the crank shaft.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">While the <b>planetary type</b> of change-speed
mechanism, which is in extensive
use for runabouts and light
commercial wagons, also employs gears, their
arrangement is along different lines. The first
three diagrams in Fig. 35 serve to illustrate the
principle.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>

</div>

<p>The gear <em>A</em> in these diagrams is attached
directly to the crank shaft, and in mesh with it
are four other gears (<em>B</em>) of the same size. Surrounding
them is an <b>internal gear</b> (<em>C</em>), this being
a ring with teeth cut on its inner face, the four
gears meshing with it. The shafts, or <b>studs</b>,
on which the four gears revolve are supported
by a metal ring (<em>D</em>), which maintains the gears
at equal distances from each other. The first
diagram shows the mechanism in the reverse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>position, for driving the car backward, the car
being driven by the internal gear. To have
the internal gear revolve in the direction opposite
to that of the crank shaft, as is necessary,
the ring supporting the four gears is held stationary,
with the result that as the crank-shaft gear
revolves the four gears are revolved on their
studs. As these gears are in mesh with the
internal gear, that is revolved, and moves in
the same direction as the four gears and in the
opposite direction to the crank shaft.</p>

<p>For the low-speed forward, the ring is released
and the internal gear held stationary, the car now
being driven by the ring instead of by the internal
gear. If the four gears were free from the
internal gear, they and their ring would revolve
with the crank-shaft gear without rotating on
their studs, but being in mesh with the internal
gear, they roll around it as a wheel rolls along
the ground, rotating on their studs. A simple
experiment that will illustrate this motion is to
crook the forefinger around a napkin ring or
similar object, placing a pencil between it and
the finger, and revolving the ring with the other
hand. The finger being stationary, the pencil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
which is revolved in the opposite direction to
the ring, will roll along it. In this the napkin
ring represents the crank-shaft gear, the pencil
one of the four gears, and the finger the internal
gear. As the four gears roll around, the ring
moves also, for it is carried by the studs on which
the four gears revolve. If each of the four gears
has fifty teeth, and the internal gear two hundred
teeth, each gear must make four revolutions
in order to roll around the internal gear
to the point where it started. The crank-shaft
gear also having fifty teeth, it revolves at the
same speed, and as four revolutions of the four
gears are necessary in order that they may roll
completely around the internal gear, the crank-shaft
gear will make four revolutions in the same
time. The ring moves with the four gears,
and revolves once around the crank shaft in
the same time. As the car moves according
to the rotation of this ring, it will go at one
quarter the speed that it would make if the
wheels were directly connected with the crank
shaft instead of with the ring.</p>

<p>For the high speed, the internal gear and the
ring are locked to the crank shaft so that all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
revolve together, the wheels being driven by
either the ring or the internal gear.</p>

<p>In these diagrams the drive of the wheels is
supposed to be shifted from the internal gear to
the ring, which is not a practical arrangement,
and the planetary change-speed mechanism as
applied to an automobile is shown in the lower
diagram in Fig. 35.</p>

<p>In this there are two sets of crank-shaft gears,
gears and rings, and internal gears, one set
being for the reverse and the other for low and
high speeds. Between the two crank-shaft
gears is a loose sleeve, one end of which forms
the internal gear for the reverse, and the other
end the ring supporting the studs on which
revolve the four gears for the low speed. The
sprocket for the chain drive to the rear axle is
carried on this sleeve. Two more loose sleeves
are on the shaft, one forming the ring on which
revolve the four gears for the reverse, and being
extended to form a brake drum outside of the
internal gear, and the other carrying the internal
gear for the low-speed combination, its outside
face serving as a brake drum.</p>

<p>To obtain the reverse, a brake band is tightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
on the drum of the reverse combination,
which holds stationary the ring supporting the
four gears, giving the result shown on the first
diagram of the four gears revolving on their
studs, and rotating the internal gear in the
direction opposite to that of the crank shaft.
The sleeve bearing the sprocket is thus revolved,
and the car backs.</p>

<p>For the low speed, the reverse brake band is
loosened, and the internal gear of the low-speed
combination held stationary by the tightening
of the brake band surrounding its drum. The
revolution of the crank-shaft gear causes the
four gears to revolve on their studs and to roll
around the internal gear, revolving the ring
and the sleeve bearing the sprocket, which
now turns in the direction opposite to that
resulting to the application of the reverse, or in
the same direction as the crank shaft.</p>

<p>For the high speed, a clutch is engaged that
locks the internal gear to the crank shaft, and
the four gears then being held between these
two are carried around with them, and the
sprocket rotates accordingly. When this combination
is used, none of the gears are in motion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
all revolving with the crank shaft but not on
their studs.</p>

<p>The planetary change-speed mechanism gives
excellent results for light work, but having only
two speeds forward is not adapted to high-powered
cars. As the speeds result from the
tightening of brake bands on the drums, there
is no danger of damaging the gears by mishandling,
for the brakes will slip before the
teeth will give way. The brakes, which are
leather-lined strips of steel, require attention
from the wearing of the leather, and the slipping
that results from oil working in between them
and their drums. No foot clutch is necessary,
for the tightening and loosening of the brake
bands is controlled by a lever; in some designs,
the reverse is applied by means of a foot pedal,
and this may be used in braking the car.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 36.—Individual Clutch and Friction Drive.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The <b>individual-clutch</b> type of change-speed
mechanism consists of two shafts, one being an
extension of the crank shaft, and the other
parallel to it (Fig. 36). On the crank shaft is
a sleeve bearing the sprocket and a gear, this
sleeve being so arranged that it may revolve
loosely, or be locked to the crank shaft and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>made to revolve with it by a clutch. The crank
shaft in addition bears two fixed gears, one
being for the low speed and the other for the
reverse. On the countershaft is a fixed gear
in mesh with the gear carried on the sleeve on
the crank shaft, and two loose sleeves bearing
gears that are in mesh with the fixed low-speed
and reverse gears on the crank shaft. These
sleeves are provided with clutches by which
they may be locked to the countershaft to revolve
with it, or disconnected from it. When
the three clutches are disengaged, the crank
shaft in revolving carries with it the fixed low-speed
and reverse gears, the sleeve bearing the
sprocket and gear remaining stationary. The
sleeves on the countershaft revolve because
their gears are in mesh with the fixed crank-shaft
gears, but the countershaft remains
stationary. In engaging the low speed, the
clutch is thrown in, forcing the countershaft
to revolve with the fixed gear, the fixed gear
on the countershaft then revolving the gear
and driving sprocket carried on the sleeve on
the crank shaft. Because of the difference in
the size of the gears, the countershaft will revolve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
at a slower speed than the crank shaft,
and the driving sprocket will make but one
revolution while the crank shaft makes several.
This it is free to do, for the sleeve carrying the
sprocket is in no way connected with the crank
shaft. For the high speed, the low-speed clutch
is withdrawn, and the driving-sprocket clutch
engaged, causing the sprocket to revolve with
the crank shaft.</p>

<p>The reverse is caused by the introduction of
an idler gear between the gears of the crank shaft
and countershaft, by which the movement of the
latter is reversed.</p>

<p>The application of the <b>friction type</b> of change-speed
mechanism to automobiles is recent, and
is giving good results for light work. It consists
in its simplest form of a heavy disk carried
on the engine shaft, on the face of which runs
a wheel sliding on a square shaft, so that the
two may be in contact at any point from the
edge to the center of the disk (Fig. 36). When
the wheel is at the center of the disk it is not
moved, and the number of speeds at which the
square shaft may be driven in relation to that
of the disk varies from nothing to the limit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
which is obtained when the wheel is in contact
with the outer edge of the disk. For the reverse,
the wheel is moved across the center of
the disk, where it is revolved in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>Another form of friction drive provides two
driving disks, the wheel bearing against both,
so that its movement is more positive, and there
is less chance for slipping.</p>


<h3>FINAL DRIVE</h3>

<p>From the change-speed mechanism the power
is passed to the driving wheels by the <b>final drive</b>.</p>

</div>

<p>In the most usual construction the engine is
so placed that the crank shaft is at right angles
to the axle, and it is therefore necessary to
change the direction in which the power acts,
which is done by means of <b>bevel gears</b>. In
ordinary spur gears the teeth are parallel to
the shaft, and the two shafts that carry them
are parallel, while in bevel gears the teeth are
at an angle, and the shafts may be at right
angles to each other. In Fig. 37 the diagram
of the <b>single-chain drive</b> illustrates a car in
which the engine is in the center of the frame,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>and as the crank shaft is parallel to the axle,
the power may be directly applied. In the illustration
of the <b>propeller</b> or <b>driving-shaft drive</b>
the crank shaft is at right angles to the axle,
and the power is turned by means of the bevel
gears at the rear axle.</p>

<p>The single-chain drive can only be used for
light cars, and is usually applied in connection
with a change-speed mechanism of the planetary
type.</p>

<p>The propeller-shaft drive requires the use of
<b>universal joints</b>, which are devices that permit
one shaft to drive another, even though they
are at an angle with each other. A typical
universal joint is illustrated in Fig. 38. The
ends of the shafts bear yokes, the ends of which
are pivoted to a block of metal of + shape.
When the two shafts are in line, the joint will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>force one to rotate with the other, and this
will not be prevented if the two are out of line,
for then the pivots will act, the + swinging
on its pivots in the yokes.</p>

<p>The change-speed mechanism is carried on

by the springs, but the axle end of the driving
shaft follows the axle as that follows the inequalities
of the road. One end of the propeller
shaft is therefore comparatively stationary,
while the other is in constant motion, and if the
shaft were inflexible it would be jammed in its
bearings and twisted out of line. This is prevented
by the universal joints with which the
shaft is provided, there being one and often
two in the shaft, and usually one between the
clutch and change-speed mechanism.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.—Live Axle—Full Floating Type.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The single-chain and driving-shaft drives require
the use of a <b>live axle</b>, which is an axle that
revolves with the wheels. The simple type
of live axle consists of the shaft to which the
wheels are attached, and the <b>housing</b> that contains
and supports it (Fig. 39). This axle is
continuous, and usually has square ends that
fit into the square hubs of the wheels so there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>may be no slipping. The second diagram in
Fig. 40 shows a live axle of the <b>floating</b> type,
in which the revolving part serves only to turn
the wheels. The housing is extended, and the
wheels run on its ends, the driving part projecting
beyond the housing and having square
ends that are secured to the outside of the
hubs by square caps. The wheels thus run on
the housing, which takes the weight of the car
from the driving part. A live axle must be
divided into two parts in order that a differential
gear may be fitted, and the housing must therefore
be strong enough to support the weight
and prevent sagging. The efficiency of a bevel
gear is greatly reduced if the teeth are not in
their exact mesh, and sagging of the axle will
throw them out to such an extent that they will
be noisy, and wear rapidly. The floating type
of live axle, in relieving the driving part of the
weight, has a great advantage over the simple
type, and is in general use.</p>

is supported in Bearings at the Differential end, and drives the wheels through clutches in the hubs.</p></div>
</div>

<p>With the driving-shaft drive it is necessary
to use a <b>torsion rod</b>, which extends from the
gear case, or a crosspiece of the frame, to the
rear axle. The necessity for this is the tendency
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>of the driving bevel gear to roll around
on the driven bevel gear rather than to revolve
it. If it were not for the torsion rod, there
would be a continual strain on the parts because
of the tendency of the axle housing to
revolve around the axle, instead of the axle
being revolved inside of the housing. The torsion
rod has a flexible joint at one end, that
permits it to give as the axle follows an uneven
road surface, but it retains the housing
in the correct position, preventing the bevel
gears from getting out of line (Fig. 41).</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.—Double Side-Chain Drive.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 42 is shown a car with <b>double-chain
drive</b>, in which the bevel gears that change the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>direction in which the power is applied are
contained within the <b>gear case</b> that incloses the
change-speed mechanism. As will be seen from
Fig. 34, the bevel gears connect the square shaft
with the <b>jack shaft</b>, which is a shaft passing
across the car, and bearing on its ends the
sprockets by which the wheels are driven.
This type of drive requires the use of a <b>dead
axle</b>, which is stationary with the wheels running
loose on its ends, like the axle and wheels
of a coach. An axle of this type may have
great strength with light weight, and is usually
a manganese-bronze or steel forging. The
sprockets on the rear wheels are bolted to the
spokes, and should be, of course, exactly in
line with the sprockets on the jack shaft in
order that the chains may run true.</p>


<h3>DIFFERENTIAL</h3>

<p>When a car takes a corner, the outside wheels
make a larger curve than the inside, and cover
a longer distance. As the front wheels are
loose on the axle, they accommodate themselves
to this; but as both rear wheels are driven by
the engine, it is necessary to apply a device<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
that will permit them to rotate at different
speeds without interfering with their driving
the car. This is accomplished by means of a
<b>compensating and differential gear</b>.</p>

<p>To understand the necessity for a differential,
stand behind a wagon, with one hand on each
tire; push, and if the vehicle is steered straight
ahead, the hands will move ahead equally; but
if the vehicle turns, the hand on the outside
wheel will move ahead faster than the other.
Now take a stick, and run it through the rear
wheels so that it bears against the spokes;
press it forward from its center, and if the
vehicle moves straight ahead, the stick will go
forward equally; but if the vehicle turns, the
outside end of the stick will go ahead faster
and farther than the other, although the pressure
is being applied to its center.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image154" style="max-width: 48.5em;">

  <div class="caption">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.—Differentials.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In applying a simple form of differential
the axle is divided into two parts, to the inner
ends of which are fitted bevel gears, these being
held at a fixed distance apart by the construction
of the housing (Fig. 43). Between the
bevel gears and in mesh with both of them are
small bevel gears, or <b>pinions</b>, which may revolve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>on short studs carried on a ring so that they
are a fixed distance apart. When the ring is
revolved it carries with it the studs and pinions.
The ring forms a housing that incloses the
differential, and is driven by the single chain
or driving shaft. To understand the action of
the differential, imagine the rear wheels of a
car to be jacked up clear of the ground so that
they are free to revolve, and the housing to be
revolved by hand. As it turns, the driving
wheels will turn also, for the resistance to each
is the same, and the pinions, being in mesh
with both bevel gears, cannot revolve on their
studs. If one of the wheels is now held stationary
and the housing revolved, the bevel pinions
will revolve on their studs, and roll around on
the stationary gear; this will drive the gear of
the free wheel at twice the speed of the housing.
The revolving of the housing in the first instance
caused the wheels to turn equally at the speed
of the ring, and in the second permitted one
to remain stationary while the other turned
at twice the speed of the housing, the speed of
the latter being unchanged. The first is the
effect when the car moves straight ahead, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
the second the result if the car could make so
short a turn that it would pivot on one wheel.</p>

<p>With the wheels jacked up, hold one hand
lightly against one of the wheels, so that while
it may turn, there is more resistance to it than
to the other. If the housing is now revolved,
the bevel pinions will revolve on their studs,
and roll slowly around the gear of the wheel
that presents the resistance, the free wheel
being revolved at a higher speed than the
housing. This is the condition when the car
takes a corner, for there is then more resistance
to the inside than to the outside wheel, and it
slows down; this will start the pinions revolving
on their studs, and they will drive the outside
wheel correspondingly faster.</p>

<p>With the housing revolving at a fixed speed,
the outside wheel will revolve as much faster
as the inner wheel is revolving slower; for an
illustration, if the housing makes fifty revolutions
a minute, and the inner wheel is slowed
to forty, the outer will be driven at sixty revolutions.</p>

<p>If one wheel of a jacked-up car is revolved
by hand, the other wheel will revolve in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
opposite direction. This is caused by the housing
remaining stationary and the pinions being
revolved on their studs by the turning of the
wheel, the movement being transmitted to
the free bevel gear and wheel in the reverse
direction.</p>

<p>The bevel gear differential described was the
early type, but a more recent design employs
spur gears. The axle ends carry spur instead
of bevel gears, these being in mesh with other
spur gears that are long, but of small diameter.
These small gears are in pairs, as shown
in Fig. 43, being in mesh with each other at
their inner ends, and each member of a pair
meshing with one of the axle gears. The small
gears revolve on studs supported by the housing
that is revolved by the drive, the studs in this
case being parallel with the axle instead of at
right angles to it, as are the studs in the bevel-gear
type.</p>

<p>If the small gears meshed only with the axle
gears, and not with each other, revolving the
housing would cause them to roll around the
axle gears, all rotating on their studs in the
same direction, and the axle gears remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
stationary. Being in mesh with each other,
they cannot revolve in the same direction, for
when two gears are in mesh they must revolve
in opposite directions. Thus the small gears
cannot roll around on the axle gears when the
housing is revolved, and if there is equal resistance
to the turning of the wheels, the small
gears will not revolve on their studs, but will
carry the axle gears with them.</p>

<p>If the car is turning a corner, the greater
resistance to the inner wheel will cause the
small gears to revolve on their studs, rolling
around the resisting gear and driving the other
correspondingly faster.</p>

<p>On cars with double-chain drive, the differential
is fitted to the jack shaft, and of course
receives the drive from the change-speed
mechanism through its housing.</p>

<p>Both the driving-shaft and double-chain
drive have points of advantage and of weakness,
and each type has its advocates. For
the double chain, great strength can be claimed
with light weight, as the axle is in one piece,
and perfectly adapted to support the car.
Against it is the difficulty of keeping the chains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
properly lubricated, and their consequent wear
and stretching. The driving-shaft type has
the advantage of the perfect lubrication of the
parts, for all may be inclosed and running in
oil or grease; the rear axle must be divided,
however, which requires it to be heavily braced
in order that the weight imposed on it may
not bend or spring it out of line. Where
a bent dead axle can be straightened by a
blacksmith, a similar condition in a live axle
requires the services of an expert mechanic; on
the other hand, bevel gears make less noise
than chains.</p>


<h3>DRIVING-GEAR RATIOS</h3>

<p>Even when on the direct drive, the crank
shaft makes more revolutions than the rear
wheels, in order that the momentum of the
moving parts of the engine may be sufficient
to keep the car in motion. On shaft-driven
cars, the bevel on the driving shaft has fewer
teeth than that on the axle, so that it revolves
more than once to one revolution of the axle.
On chain-driven cars, the driving sprockets
are smaller than those driven. This <b>driving-gear ratio</b>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
as it is called, varies from one and a
half to three and a half, or, in other words, the
wheels revolve once while the driving shaft or
sprocket makes from one and a half to three
and a half revolutions. Other conditions remaining
equal, a higher driving gear gives the
car lower speed, but greater ability in hill-climbing
and the traversing of heavy roads.</p>

<span class="fs80">RUNNING GEAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The steering of a motor car, or the change
in the direction of its movement, is
effected by changing the position of
its steering wheels, usually those in front, in
relation to the rear wheels. In a horse-drawn
vehicle, the axles are parallel when it is moving
straight, as are also the planes of its front and
rear wheels. To turn the vehicle to one side
or the other the front axle is swung so that
it is out of parallel with the rear axles, the
vehicle turning to the side on which the axles
would meet if they were extended. This construction
requires the wheels to run loose on
the axle, and the axle to be permitted to swing
on the pivot by which it is attached to the
body of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Such a construction would be impracticable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
for an automobile, because the weight resting
on the front axle would require the pivot to
be of greater strength and stiffness than could
be conveniently obtained, and because of the
effort that would be necessary to swing the
axle in steering. The front axle of an automobile
is stationary, and the steering effect is
obtained by pivoting short pieces to its ends,
these carrying the wheels. From these pivoted
ends, called <b>knuckles</b>, extend short <b>steering
arms</b>, which are connected by a <b>drag link</b>, so
that moving the drag link moves the pivoted
ends of the axle and the wheels to correspond
(Fig. 44).</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.—Steering Principles.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>For a wheel to follow a curved path without
slipping, it must be at all times tangent to the
path, and will be perpendicular to a radius of
the curve at that point. The front axle of a
horse-drawn vehicle points toward the center
of the circle on which the vehicle may be turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
and forms part of the radius, the wheels, of
course, being perpendicular to it (Fig. 45). As
the main part of the front axle of an automobile
is stationary, only its pivoted ends may point
to the center of the circle, and this must occur
in order that the wheels may be tangent to the
curve (Fig. 45). Both axle ends point to the
center, but along different radii; if both pointed
along the same radius, it would necessitate their
being in line with the stationary part of the
axle, which then also would be part of the radius.
As the axle ends are in line with different radii
of the same curve, it follows that the wheels are
perpendicular to different radii, and not parallel
with each other, a condition impossible in horse-drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
vehicles. The front wheels of an automobile
are parallel with each other when the
axle ends are in line with the stationary part,
but go out of parallel as soon as they are at an
angle with it, as is the case when the car takes
a curve.</p>

<p>If the steering arms projected from the
knuckles at right angles to the axle ends on
which the wheels revolve, moving the drag link
would move each knuckle through an equal
angle, and the wheels would be parallel at all
times; this is prevented by so constructing the
knuckles that the steering arms incline toward
each other, with the result that when the drag
link is moved, one of the wheels swings through
a greater angle than the other, the difference
between the angle of each steering arm and the
stationary part of the axle increasing with a
greater movement of the drag link.</p>

<p>The control of the drag link is obtained either
by a <b>steering lever</b> or <b>wheel</b>. When the steering
lever is moved by the driver, the drag link is
moved to correspond by a connecting rod, and
this type is usual in small cars. It is impracticable
for heavy cars because it is <b>reversible</b>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
that is, the moving of the steering wheels moves
the lever, and a firm grasp is required to prevent
the shock of striking a stone or rut from tearing
the lever from the hand and changing the course
of the car. The <em>irreversible</em> type is used for all
but the lightest cars, and while it permits the
driver to change the direction of the front wheels
it prevents any movement from being transmitted
from the wheels to the steering wheel
or lever. The <b>screw-and-nut type</b> of irreversible
steering mechanism (Fig. 46, <em>B</em>) consists of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
heavy screw attached to the lower end of the
shaft that revolves when the driver turns the
steering wheel. The screw passes through a
nut that is held in guides so that it cannot
revolve, and is therefore moved up or down
when the screw is turned by the steering wheel.
From the nut extends an arm that is connected
to the drag link, so that its movement is transmitted
to the wheels. The turning of the steering
wheel thus moves the nut and the front
wheels, but a movement of the front wheels
from any other cause is prevented, because no
pressure on the nut can revolve the screw.
Another type is the <b>worm-and-worm wheel</b>, or
<b>worm-and-segment</b> (Fig. 46, <em>A</em>), which, while of
different construction, depends on the same
principle that the movement of the worm or
screw can move a worm wheel or nut in mesh
with it, but the movement cannot be reversed.</p>

<p>The stationary part of the front axle of an
automobile is usually a forging, and must be of
considerable strength in order to support the
weight imposed upon it by the engine. It is
usually bent down in the center, in order that
it may be the lowest point of the mechanism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
thus to receive possible blows of stones or other
high points of the road that would cause serious
damage should they strike the crank case or
fly wheel.</p>


<h3>BRAKES</h3>

<p>The brakes used in controlling the speed
of an automobile may be as many as four in
number, and there should be at least two, for
on them depends the safety of the car. Brakes
are of two types, <b>expanding</b> and <b>contracting</b>,
and usually operate through the friction between
a drum and a band that surrounds it,
or blocks that press against its inner surface.
The <b>band</b> or <b>contracting</b> brake may be either
<b>single-</b> or <b>double-acting</b>, the latter being by
far the better. In a single-acting band brake
(Fig. 47) a flexible steel band surrounds the
drum, one end being made fast to the frame of
the car or some other stationary part, and pressure
applied by drawing the free end. The
friction caused by the binding of the leather or
fiber lining of the band on the drum restrains
the movement if the drum is revolving in the
opposite direction to the pull, but there is little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
effect if the revolution is in the same direction
as the pull. In the double-acting type, both
ends of the band are pulled, and the drum is
prevented from revolving
in either direction.
The single-acting type
would be satisfactory
when the car moves forward,
but will not hold
it from running downhill backward, while the
double-acting brake holds it in either direction.
The expanding brake usually consists of two
bronze <b>shoes</b>, of such shape that they fit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
interior surface of the drum. The shoes are
pivoted together at one end, and so arranged
that the pull of the brake pedal or lever expands
them, binding them against the drum (Fig. 47).
When pressure is not being exerted, a coil
spring, not shown in the diagram, holds them
together and out of contact with the drum.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp77" id="image168" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image168.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.—Three Varieties of Brakes.</span></p></div>
</div>


<p>Brake drums are usually attached to the
spokes of the rear wheels, and one drum often
serves for both an expanding and a contracting
brake. Brake drums are also applied to the
jack shaft, or to an extension of the countershaft
of the change-speed mechanism. It is
usual to have one set of brakes controlled by a
foot pedal, and another, called the <b>emergency
brake</b>, by a lever at the side of the car. The
foot brake, or <b>running brake</b>, is always connected
to the clutch, so that applying it throws out the
clutch. The emergency brake is also connected
in the same manner in some makes of automobiles,
but this is not recommended, for if it
is necessary to stop the car when going uphill,
the brakes must be released before the clutch
can be thrown in, and the possibility of the
car starting downhill backward before power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
can be applied, the chance of stalling the engine
through this, and the danger of the combination
to any but an experienced driver, make it advisable
to have the emergency brake separate
from any connection with the clutch.</p>

<p>Band brakes are usually lined with leather,
to increase the friction between the band and
the drum, and this often gives rise to troubles
in the burning of the leather when the brake is
applied for a considerable period, as in the descent
of a long hill. The emergency brake has
advantages in that it operates through the
friction of metal against metal, but excessive
heat from continued application may be enough
to melt the metal and fuse together the shoe
and drum. For long descents, it is well to use
the motor as a brake, for it is logical to consider
that the means of propulsion may also be
the means of retarding, as the wind that urges
a sailboat forward may also bring it to a stop.
It is obviously impossible to reverse the motor
or gears, but by switching off the ignition circuit
and throttling down, the forward movement of
the car is caused to operate the motor, and the
work necessary in driving the motor as an air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
compressor is sufficient to check the speed. The
effect is so great that if the low-speed gears are
engaged, the car will be brought to a stop even on
a steep hill. Another advantage of this course is
that it gives the motor an opportunity to cool,
which is often necessary after a long ascent.</p>

<p>In case of the failure of the brakes to operate,
which may result from poor adjustment or worn
bands and shoes, the speed may be checked
by throwing out the clutch, switching off the
ignition, engaging the intermediate speed gears,
and letting in the clutch very slowly. Great
care must be taken that the clutch is not permitted
to bind suddenly, for that would probably
result in the stripping of the gears. If the
low-speed gears are engaged, the checking would
be so sudden, no matter how slowly the clutch
might be engaged, that the shock would probably
throw the passengers from their seats.</p>

<p>The failure of the brakes when descending
a hill produces a condition that requires skill
and coolness, and danger can only be averted
by a steady hand and a clear head.</p>

<p>Brakes applied to the rear wheels must have
an equal grip on each, for if one binds more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
tightly than the other, the car will have a
tendency to skid, or slide sideways. In the best
cars this is taken care of by an <b>equalizer</b>, in
which the pull of the lever or pedal is not
applied directly to the brakes, but to the center
of a bar, each end of which is connected to one
of the bands or shoes. The lever action of
this bar distributes the pull equally between the
two brakes, and unless there is a great difference
in the grip on the two drums, as might be the
case if one were oily and the other dry, the
effect will be the same on both sides.</p>


<h3>TIRES</h3>

<p>For low speeds, solid tires give good results
in traction and the absorption of jolts from small
obstacles, but for anything above six or eight
miles an hour, pneumatic tires are a necessity
in preventing the rapid shaking to pieces of the
mechanism. A hard tire touches the ground
at but one point, and its grip on the road will
be much less than that of a pneumatic tire
which, being slightly flattened by the weight
it bears, presents an oval or elliptical surface
to the road. While a pebble will force a solid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
tire to roll over it, it will sink into a pneumatic
tire, and the jolt that it might cause will be
entirely absorbed. Pneumatic tires are formed
of alternate layers of heavy canvaslike fabric
and soft rubber, and the processes through
which they are put in manufacture are supposed
to effect their perfect combination; but as it is
not the nature of rubber to be absorbed by the
fabric, the layers are only bound together by
its tenacity. The bending of the sides of the
tire under the weight of the car tends to separate
these layers, and water or dirt entering between
them through cuts quickly brings ruin; it is
obvious that the less the sides bend, the smaller
will be the opportunity for the layers to work
apart. A pneumatic tire should always be
pumped as hard as possible, so that it stands up
practically round under a loaded car. While
the car will ride a little harder under these
conditions than when the tires are soft, there
will be greater resistance to punctures, and the
life of the tires will be increased. The normal
wear to a tire should give it a smooth surface,
but if it is noticed that the tread is rough and
uneven, it may be taken for granted that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
wheels do not run true. Rear wheels will be
thrown out of true by the springing or bending
of the axle, and front wheels also from this cause,
but more probably from faulty adjustment of
the steering mechanism or the bending of the
drag link or steering arms.</p>

<p>The grip of the tire on the road is much
affected by the nature of the surface, the traction
on dry macadam being much greater than
on wet asphalt. When the pull of the engine on
the wheel exceeds the grip of the tire on the road,
there will be a slip, and the wheel will revolve
without moving the car. This will wear the
tread of the tire far more rapidly than will
ordinary running. The better the traction of
the tires on the road surface, the less will be
the tendency of the car to skid or slide sideways,
and less power will be lost through the slipping
of the wheels. To reduce the chance of slipping,
because of wet asphalt or muddy roads, various
devices are in use, all of which encircle the tread
of the tire, and present a rough surface. The
form in most general use consists of chains that
fit across the tread, these being detachable
and used only in case of necessity. While it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
often done, it is nevertheless bad practice to
apply chains or other antiskid devices to only
one of the rear wheels instead of to both, for
it increases the diameter of the wheel and makes
a difference in the resistance against the wheel,
causing the differential to operate at all times.
The differential is not constructed to operate
steadily, and will wear rapidly if forced to
do so.</p>


<h3>SPRINGS</h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image175" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image175.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span>—<em>A</em>, Full elliptic spring; <em>B</em>, half elliptic spring.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In addition to tires, an automobile is fitted
with springs, which are necessary to absorb the
shocks and jolts that are too great to be taken
up by the tires. These are usually <b>full</b> or
<b>half elliptic</b> (Fig. 48), and made of flat plates,
or <b>leaves</b>, of different lengths, the small being
placed on the large, and all bound together at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
the center. The combined action of the springs
and tires permits the frame and body of the car
to move in a nearly straight line, while the wheels
and axles follow the inequalities of the road.
When springs break, as is frequently the case, it is
from the rebound of the body that results when
the wheels drop into a deep hole, the upward
movement separating the leaves, and the entire
strain coming on the long leaves alone. To
prevent this, <b>shock absorbers</b> are recommended,
which permit the springs to have a certain
amount of action, but check them if they tend
to expand or compress to too great an extent.
They act either by the friction between metal
plates and washers, or by air or oil in a cylinder
that permits a piston to move freely to a certain
degree, but presents resistance to a greater
motion. Shock absorbers are placed between
the axles and frame, and there should be four,
two to each axle.</p>


<h3>DISTANCE RODS</h3>

<p>As the springs are placed between the axles
and body and are flexible, it is necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
provide some method of preventing an obstruction
in the road from twisting the axle,
as might result if one wheel struck heavy sand
or a stone while its mate was on good surface.
A twist of this sort would throw the axle out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
of line with the drive and bind the chain or
driving shaft.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image177" style="max-width: 58em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image177.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.—Distance or Radius Rods.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>To prevent this, <b>radius</b> or <b>distance rods</b> are
attached to the axle, one on each side, extending
to a point well forward on the frame (Fig. 49).
These rods are pivoted to the frame, and have
a loose joint on the axle, so that the latter is
free to move up and down, but prevented from
moving forward or back. Distance rods are
adjustable, and on chain-driven cars serve to
adjust the chains, which are tightened by
lengthening the rods and slackened by shortening
them.</p>

<span class="fs80">TROUBLES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Practice and experience are the best
instructors in keeping the car running,
and the operator quickly acquires the
ability to recognize the source of trouble from
the action of the engine in failing to deliver
power, or from the manner in which it stops.
Each part of the mechanism may be counted on
to give trouble, and the possibilities are numerous,
but in general it may be said that an
interference with the proper operation of the
engine may be laid to the failure of the ignition
system or gasoline supply, a defect of the
combustion space in not retaining the pressure,
or the overheating of the engine.</p>


<h3>IGNITION TROUBLES</h3>

<p>The ignition system is the greatest producer
of trouble, and the reason is usually difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
to locate. Any interference with the flow of
the current, or leaks by which it evades passing
over the entire circuit, will cause irregular
running or the stopping of the engine, and the
circuit must be maintained in the best possible
condition in order to prevent these as much as
possible. The wires should be well insulated,
the insulation of the secondary circuit being
heavier than that of the primary because of
the higher pressure of the current that must
be retained. The constant vibration to which
the wires are subjected requires the use of
cable composed of a number of strands of fine
wire rather than a single heavy wire, for the
latter is much more liable to be broken; but in
securing the end of a cable under a nut, great
care must be exercised that all of the strands
are bound. A single strand is hardly noticeable,
but if it comes into contact with uninsulated
metal, it will permit the current to leak. In
making connections, the best plan is to solder
the end of the cable to a copper or brass terminal
which holds the strands secure, and gives a firm
bearing for the nut. Before making connections
the terminals should be scraped bright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
and after running the nuts down firmly, covered
with vaseline to prevent corrosion. Corrosion
of copper or brass produces a greenish deposit
(copper sulphate) which is an insulator, and
when it forms between the terminals of the
conductor it produces high resistance, cutting
down or even preventing the flow of current.
A worse effect of corrosion is to bind the nuts
on the screws, preventing their removal. A
loose connection presents resistance to the flow
of current, and the current will flow irregularly,
as the vibrations bring the terminals together
or separate them. A wire broken at a terminal
is easily seen, but when a break occurs inside
of the insulation, it is more difficult to detect.
When a broken wire is suspected, its circuit
may be located by testing, and new wires laid,
one length at a time, until the faulty one is
replaced. It is poor economy to use cheap
wire, for the best is none too good for the hard
use to which it is put. The wearing away of
insulation by chafing will produce a short circuit,
and the wires should be prevented from coming
into contact with any part of the car or engine
in such a manner as to give this result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>


<h3>THE BATTERY</h3>

<p>When a battery is exhausted, or nearly so,
it will not magnetize the core of the coil sufficiently
to induce a current that will give a strong
enough spark to ignite the mixture. The
length of time that a battery should last, or
the mileage that it should give, is learned from
experience, and when it is exhausted in less
time there is evidence that it has either been
short-circuited or that the current has been
used too extravagantly.</p>

<p>The extra source of current that should be
provided should not be switched into circuit
until the short circuit that exhausted the
regular source has been located and removed,
or there will be a further waste of current. It
occasionally happens that through carelessness
the battery is so connected that one of the cells
is reversed, in which case the current will be
reduced by the loss of the current from two
cells, for the energy of the reversed cell will
neutralize that of another. If both sets of
battery have become exhausted by short
circuit, current for further running may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
obtained by connecting the two sets together
in multiple, supposing that each set is, as is
usual, connected in series.</p>

<p>An apparently exhausted dry battery will
recuperate, or pick up, if allowed to stand, but
a storage battery that shows 1.8 volts or less
for each cell should be immediately recharged,
for further use will cause fatal injury.</p>


<h3>THE MAGNETO</h3>

<p>The principal troubles that come to magnetos
are due to lack of lubrication and the weakening
of the permanent magnets. The clearance between
the armature and the pole pieces between
which it revolves is very small, and even slight
wear of the bearings through insufficient lubrication
will permit the armature to touch. The
oil cups with which the bearings are provided
must be kept filled, or if the parts are connected
to a mechanical lubricator, the proper adjustment
must be maintained.</p>

<p>When a magnet is permitted to stand without
a piece of iron connecting the poles, the magnetism
will dissipate; to prevent this, a bar of
soft iron, called a <b>keeper</b>, is placed across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
poles, the magnetic lines of force flowing through
it from one pole to the other, and the strength
being retained. The permanent magnets forming
the field of a magneto are very strongly magnetized,
and the proportion of the strength lost
through misuse will be large, resulting in their
being weakened to such an extent that the
current produced will not be sufficient for
ignition purposes. These magnets can be re-magnetized
by the makers when this occurs,
the magneto regaining its current-producing
ability.</p>

<p>The strength of the magnets will be retained
for a much longer period if, when the car is
standing, the armature is in such a position
that it acts as a keeper; this will occur when
its iron core is horizontal. As the armature
will be in this position when the current is
being produced, it is only necessary to bring
the engine to a stop at the point when one of
the pistons is approaching the end of a compression
stroke. On leaving the car, the low
speed should be engaged and the clutch withdrawn;
the engine may be cranked slowly, and
the armature held in position by throwing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the clutch to hold the crank shaft when compression
is nearly complete.</p>

<p>It is most inadvisable to take a magneto to
pieces without an exact knowledge of its construction.
Except for lubricating the bearings,
it is best to leave it entirely alone. In setting
a magneto, it must be remembered that it is
not delivering current continuously, and that
when the iron core of the armature is parallel
to the poles of the magnets no current is produced.
The greatest strength of current is
delivered as the core moves into a vertical
position, and revolving the armature by the
fingers will show this, for during part of a
revolution it will turn easily, and during the
rest of the revolution there will be resistance.
The engine should be cranked until a piston is
near the top of a compression stroke; holding
it there, the magneto gear may be meshed with
that on the half-time or crank shaft in such
a manner that the armature core has moved a
trifle past the vertical position. This will result
in the production of a current at the instant
that it is necessary for the ignition of the charge.
(See Appendix.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>


<h3>THE COIL</h3>

<p>There is always a small spark between the
vibrator contacts of a coil, and in time the
platinum will be burned and corroded, the
oxide that forms being an insulator and preventing
the flow of the current. In such a case
the points may be smoothed with a fine flat file
and polished on a strip of leather, or if too far
gone for this, may be renewed by soldering a
short length of platinum wire to the adjusting
screw and a plate of the same metal to the blade.
While this job is a delicate one, it is not beyond
the range of a careful amateur.</p>

<p>When the insulation of the coil or condenser
breaks down, as may result from overwork or
long use, it should be returned to the maker,
for the construction of a coil is exceedingly
delicate, and repairs on it require expert workmanship.
It is not advisable to take the coil
apart in any way, beyond the vibrator parts,
for inexperienced handling may injure it beyond
repair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>


<h3>THE SPARK PLUG</h3>

<p>The spark plug is a frequent source of trouble,
for the insulation may break down, or a carbon
deposit may form between the points, either fault
permitting the current to pass without jumping
the gap. Plugs should be so made that when
the parts are screwed together the strain will
not come against the insulation. Porcelain
insulation is brittle, and may be cracked inside
the sleeve, the damage not showing on handling
and inspection, but being sufficient to permit
the spark to pass inside of the sleeve instead
of between the points. Mica insulation is
usually formed of a large number of washers
squeezed together under great pressure, but
the action of the heat and the presence of oil
will frequently cause the layers to separate,
permitting a short circuit.</p>

<p>The carbon deposit that fouls and short-circuits
spark plugs results from a rich mixture,
or overlubrication, and this should be prevented
by proper adjustments. Under the
intense heat the carbon bakes hard, and can
be removed only by scraping or by the action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
of strong ammonia or gasoline. As in scraping
the smooth surface of the insulation may be
scratched (which would give a rough surface to
which a fresh carbon deposit would cling more
tightly), the removal of the deposit by ammonia
or gasoline, applied with a stiff brush, is
recommended.</p>

<p>The points between which the spark passes
should be about one thirty-second of an inch
apart. After long use, the corrosion due to
the heat of the spark will increase this distance,
when the points should be bent together. The
high compression through which the spark is
required to pass presents greater resistance than
air at atmospheric pressure, practically in proportion
to the pressure, and a current that
will produce a spark outside of the cylinder
may not have sufficient pressure to give a like
result when the engine is running. If the pressure
of the compression is four times that of
the atmosphere, the current should be able to
produce a spark four thirty-seconds, or one
eighth, of an inch long outside of the cylinder,
and for safety this should be increased four-fold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>


<h3>THE IGNITER</h3>

<p>The stationary point of the igniter is carried
on the end of a screw that passes through the
cylinder head or wall, and by means of this
screw its position in relation to the moving
point may be altered as desired. The distance
between the points when they are separated
should be about one sixteenth of an inch; more
than this will result in the formation of a longer
spark between them, and as the passage of the
spark through the high resistance of the compressed
charge will produce great heat, the igniter
points will be burned and corroded more
than need be. The adjustment may be made
by loosening the lock nut on the stationary
point, and running the screw down until the
stationary point is in contact with the movable
when the latter is acted on by the cam. The
lock nut should be run down until it bears
lightly against the cylinder and the point then
unscrewed, the lock nut being carried with it,
until the latter is about one sixteenth of an
inch away from the cylinder. This gives a corresponding
distance between the igniter points,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
and running the lock nut down firmly will secure
it.</p>

<p>The tappet spring should be of considerable
strength in order to snap the movable point
from the stationary when the tappet ceases
to act. Too great strength will bring the
movable point against the stationary with
such force that the platinum plate that it
carries will be battered out of place. The
principal difficulty that is encountered is the
corrosion of these points, the flow of the current
being decreased or stopped by the insulating
film that covers them. The blow with which
the two come together tends to knock this off
and to keep the surfaces flat, but when they
become badly worn and pitted they must be
filed smooth.</p>

<p>The bearing in the cylinder wall in which
the movable point rocks is made after the
manner of a valve; the opening must be tight
in order to prevent the leakage of compression,
but sufficiently free to move as the cam acts
on the tappet. This joint cannot be lubricated
with oil because of the heat, and the two parts
must therefore be kept as smooth as possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
To attain this result they are ground together
as engine valves are ground.</p>


<h3>THE TIMER</h3>

<p>The spring that keeps the revolving part of
a timer in contact with the stationary part
must be of sufficient strength to squeeze out
the vaseline with which the timer is packed, as
otherwise the grease will form an insulating
film between them, preventing the flow of the
current. The timer must be securely attached
to its shaft, for if it is loose the contacts will be
made at the wrong time, and the sparks will
not occur in the combustion space at the correct
intervals. All of its parts and connections
should be as firm as possible. The rods with
which the stationary part is connected to the
control lever on the steering column should be
provided with adjustments by which lost motion
due to wear may be taken up. There are
usually several joints in these rods, all of which
may wear loose, and if there are no means by
which they may be kept tight, the lever will
move a considerable distance before the timer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
will respond. It is often possible to remedy
this by placing coil springs in such positions
that they take up the lost motion. A timer
should be so set on the half-time shaft that the
revolving contact is just touching the stationary
contact when the piston is at its highest point
in the cylinder on the compression stroke, the
control lever being in nearly its most retarded
position.</p>

<p>As dirt will interfere with the action of a
timer, the cover should always be in place and
tightly secured.</p>


<h3>THE SECONDARY DISTRIBUTER</h3>

<p>A secondary distributer will give trouble
through loose contacts, dirt, or the splitting
of the spark, the effect of the last being the
passing of the spark from the revolving part to
two or more contact points instead of but one.
Particles from the carbon brush in wearing off
may stick to the insulating ring between the
contacts and form a path, or a strand of wire
may project, producing the same result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>


<h3>THE SWITCH</h3>

<p>Loose switch parts will prevent the flow of
the current or give a vibrating contact, and
should be frequently looked after. If the switch
is mounted on metal, as is occasionally the
case, a loosening of the parts or the wearing
of the insulation will result in a short circuit
that is difficult to locate because the good condition
of the switch is usually taken for granted.</p>


<h3>GASOLINE TROUBLES</h3>

<p>Commercial gasoline is frequently dirty, carrying
particles of matter that will stop the fine
passages and openings of the carburetor, or containing
water, the presence of which will prevent
the proper operation of the engine. Dirt
may be removed by the use of a strainer made
of fine wire gauze, and water may be separated
by filtering the liquid through chamois skin,
the gasoline passing through and the water
remaining. It is advisable to have a strainer
and trap placed in the piping that connects
the tank with the carburetor to form the lowest
point of the system, the gasoline passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
through it and being cleansed of dirt and
water.</p>


<h3>THE TANK</h3>

<p>The tank of a gravity feed system is always
provided with a small hole or vent, usually
drilled through the filling cap, through which
air may enter to replace the gasoline that is
drawn off in the running of the engine. If this
hole becomes plugged with dirt, the escape of
the gasoline will reduce the pressure in the
tank to such an extent that further flow will
be prevented, and the engine will stop with all
of the symptoms of a lack of gasoline. On
opening the tank for the purpose of investigation,
the air supply will be renewed, and the
engine will again run, to stop slowly as before.
Clearing the hole will relieve the condition.
This vent may also cause trouble in permitting
water to enter and contaminate the gasoline,
this being liable to happen when the car is
washed.</p>

<p>The pipe by which the gasoline flows from
the tank to the carburetor should project
slightly above the bottom of the tank, to prevent
sediment from being drawn into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>As gasoline rots rubber rapidly, hose should
never be used to conduct it, nor should joints
be packed with rubber. Copper and brass are
attacked by gasoline less than other metals,
and should always be used in preference to
iron, which is corroded by the liquid. Joints
may be made tight by the use of shellac or soap.</p>


<h3>THE CARBURETOR</h3>

<p>Besides the possibility of getting out of adjustment,
the greatest trouble with a carburetor
comes from the clogging of the passages and
openings with dirt. When dirt enters, it clogs
the gasoline inlet valve and prevents it from
seating properly, the float chamber being
flooded as a result. When the level in the float
chamber is raised, more than the required
amount of gasoline flows out of the spray nozzle,
and the mixture that is produced is too rich.
This will also result from the bending of the
valve stem or the wearing of the seat, either
of which will prevent the proper shutting-off
of the flow when the correct level in the float
is reached.</p>

<p>A flooding float chamber may also be caused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
by a float that is out of adjustment on its
stem or too heavy. In the course of time the
gasoline will cut a hole through the metal of a
float and leak in, and leakage will also occur if
the soldered joints open, the float then becoming
too heavy and not closing the gasoline inlet
valve at the correct time. These holes will be
too small to permit the gasoline to be poured
out, but by placing the float in hot water, the
gasoline will be evaporated and driven out as
a gas. In repairing a float, as little solder as
possible should be used in order that the weight
of the float may not be greatly altered. A cork
float will become soggy and heavy if the varnish
coating is damaged and the gasoline soaks in.</p>

<p>Carburetors are built so that the float valve
and spray nozzle may be easily cleaned, for by
withdrawing plugs fine wire may be run through
them. When a carburetor is taken apart for
more thorough cleaning, the position of the
gasoline and air adjustments should be remembered,
in order that they may be replaced
in approximately the correct positions, thus
saving time in making the adjustments that
will be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>The main air intake should be kept clean,
especially when it is covered with a wire gauze
screen. Dirt will reduce the size of the opening,
and the air that enters will not be sufficient to
give a mixture of the correct proportion. The
screen should be kept clean and free from oil,
for the latter is a dust collector.</p>


<h3>COMPRESSION TROUBLES</h3>

<p>A leak in the combustion space will reduce
the compression by permitting the fresh mixture
to escape during the compression stroke,
and will also give an escape for the pressure
resulting from the combustion, the pressure on
the piston being reduced in consequence. The
most frequent cause of leakage is worn valves,
the intense heat tending to warp the disks and
to roughen their surfaces, the exhaust valve
being especially liable to this as it is surrounded
by the hot gases during the time that it is open.
A badly fitting spark plug, igniter stem, relief
cock, or other opening into the combustion
space will produce the same result. Whenever
possible, these parts should be fitted with copper
asbestos washers, which are soft enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
squeeze into the inequalities of the surface,
at the same time resisting the heat and pressure.</p>

<p>When piston rings or cylinder walls are cut
or scratched by running without oil, the pressure
will escape into the crank case, which,
while warm when the engine is running properly,
will be heated to a very noticeable degree under
these circumstances. The only remedy is the
use of new piston rings and the reboring of the
cylinder. Piston rings, being of cast iron, are
brittle, and must be handled carefully. To
place them in position in their grooves, thin
strips of steel, like pieces of a hack-saw blade,
should be bound to the piston, covering all but
the lower groove. The ring for this groove
can then be slipped on, and when it is in position
the steel strips moved upward to expose the
upper grooves, one at a time.</p>

<p>Piston rings are usually prevented from revolving
around the piston by pins driven into
the piston between their ends; if these are not
provided, the turning of the rings will bring
their ends into line, and the pressure will leak
through them. The appearance of the rings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
is the best indication as to whether they are
permitting leakage; if they are tight, they will
be smooth and polished all around, but if there
is leakage, they will be streaked with black
carbon deposit.</p>

<p>Other losses of compression may be due to a
cracked piston, cylinder head or wall, the former
being indicated by a hot crank case and the
latter by the presence of water in the cylinder
and crank case.</p>


<h3>COOLING TROUBLES</h3>

<p>The failing of the cooling or lubrication
systems will permit the engine to heat, and if
continued will produce disastrous results. The
radiator of a water-cooled engine should begin
to heat shortly after the engine has started,
and will rapidly become warm all over, thus
showing that the water is circulating properly.
A failure of the circulation may be due to a
clogged pump or passage, and the cause should
be located and removed without delay. Dirt
in the water is the most usual cause of the failure
of the pump, and also of the stopping of the
circulation in the gravity system. A strainer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
should be fitted to the filling cap of the radiator
to remove bits of wood, leaves, sand, etc. The
connections of the water system are frequently
made of rubber hose, and this in rotting will
free bits of rubber that will prevent the flow.
A difficulty occurring at the clamps that attach
the hose to the metal pipes is the tearing off of
a strip of the rubber lining, which closes the
passage after the manner of a valve.</p>

<p>The fan must be kept running correctly, and
if belt-driven, the belt must be kept tight and
the pulleys free from oil that would permit
slipping.</p>

<p>Water that has been heated freezes much
more readily than water that has not, and therefore
the water system of an automobile must
be carefully guarded against low temperatures.
A freeze of the water may crack the water
jackets or split the radiator, either of which
will require the laying up of the car for repairs.
The best protection is to draw off the water if
there is the slightest danger of freezing, drain
cocks being provided at the low points of the
system for this purpose. If this is not practicable,
a solution of four pounds of calcium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
chloride to the gallon of water, mixed hot and
allowed to cool, may be used, and it will stand
a temperature of 15° F. below zero without
freezing.</p>

<p>The flanges or corresponding parts of an air-cooled
motor should be kept clean, for dirt
will prevent the free radiation of heat.</p>

<p>A lack of lubricating oil, either through the
failure of the supply or the clogging of the pipes,
will cause the engine to heat and the piston to
stick or seize. When the car is new, it is better
to supply too much oil than too little, but when
the bearings have smoothed down the supply
may be reduced. The operation of the engine
is the only indication as to whether it is receiving
a proper amount of oil, and rather than run the
risk of underlubricating the piston rings and
cylinder walls, it is better to have enough to
produce a faint smoke at the exhaust pipe.
This will show that the engine is receiving a
little more than is necessary. Too much oil
in the cylinder will foul the spark plug,
and as this would prevent the passing of
the spark, it is to be as much avoided as too
little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>When the lubricator pipes are clogged, the
easiest method of clearing out the obstruction
is to force air through them by means of a foot
pump.</p>

<span class="fs80">LOCATING TROUBLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Any interference with the regular running
of an automobile is usually due to
engine trouble, and the nature of the
irregularity or the unfamiliar noise will often
give a clew to the experienced driver by which
the fault may be located. When the engine
shows that something is wrong, it is of little
use to guess at the cause, for changing an adjustment
without being sure that it is the right
thing to do will probably add to the difficulty
instead of remove it. The laying out of a system
for the location of a fault is not difficult, and
its application simplifies matters when trouble
is encountered. By following a process of
elimination, the condition of the different parts
of the mechanism can be learned, and if on test
the ignition system proves to be operating
correctly, the production of the mixture may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
be considered to be guilty until that in turn
is shown to be innocent.</p>


<h3>MAKE-AND-BREAK IGNITION</h3>

<p>An engine equipped with the make-and-break
ignition system is always provided with a conducting
bar across the top or side of the cylinders,
called a <b>bus bar</b>, connected with the
source of current, and each igniter is connected
to it through a switch. If one of the cylinders
fires regularly, it is an indication that the current
is being generated properly, and that no
time need be wasted in examining the generator.
By means of the switches, the igniters may
be tested individually by cranking the engine
with one switch closed and the others open.
When the clutch is disengaged the engine should
run on one cylinder, and if this is the case, the
igniter on the line of the closed switch is shown
to be in good condition. The opening of this
switch and the closing of the next will give a
comparison when the engine is again cranked,
and if explosions occur, the igniter points
may be adjusted until the two cylinders work
equally well. If the cylinder does not operate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the stationary igniter point should be withdrawn
and its contact examined; this should
be bright and clean. The movable point should
be worked by hand, to determine whether the
joint is stuck or the spring weak or broken.</p>

<p>If none of the cylinders show signs of explosions,
the connections should be examined to
make sure that they are secure. On systems
employing a magneto alone, the wiring consists
of a single wire from the magneto to the bus
bar, and the shorter wires from there to the
igniters. These wires are clearly visible, and
any loose connections or broken wires may be
detected without difficulty. If the connections
and wiring are in good condition, the fault may
be located in the magneto, or, if it has recently
been dismounted, its incorrect setting in relation
to the crank shaft. (See Appendix.)</p>

<p>If the ignition system proves to be in proper
working order, attention may be paid to the
carburetor and its connections.</p>


<h3>JUMP-SPARK IGNITION</h3>

<p>In testing an engine fitted with the jump-spark
ignition system, the circuit should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
closed and the crank shaft revolved twice,
attention being paid to the sound of the vibrators.
On a four-cylinder engine, the timer
makes four contacts in two revolutions of the
crank shaft, and if all of the vibrators are heard
it is proof that the primary circuit is in good
condition, and not the seat of the trouble. If
only one of the vibrators buzzes, the battery
circuit may be considered to be working properly,
for otherwise no current could have passed
to the coil box. The trouble may then be
identified as being in part if not altogether in
the adjustment of the vibrators of the dead
coils, their connections with the timer, or in
the timer itself. One end of a short piece of
wire should be touched to the timer binding
post of one of the dead coils, and the other to
any metal part of the engine, the lubricator,
for instance, to form a short circuit through the
primary circuit with the exception of the timer
and its connections. If the vibrator buzzes, the
trouble is not in the coil, but in that part of
the circuit cut out by the short-circuiting wire.
The same piece of wire may be used to bridge
across to any metal part of the engine from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
binding post on the timer at which the wire
from the coil is connected, and if the wire from
the coil to the timer is in good condition, the
vibrator will again buzz, showing that the fault
must be in the timer, for all other parts of the
primary circuit of that particular coil have
been proven to be working correctly. A dirty
or faulty contact in the timer, or a loose connection,
will probably be the cause.</p>

<p>If the primary circuit is shown to be in good
order, attention may at once be given to the
gasoline feed, for while the secondary circuits
have not been tested, it is extremely unlikely
that the spark plugs or their connections will
prove defective on all four cylinders at the
same time.</p>


<h3>THE CARBURETOR</h3>

<p>Touching the primer of the carburetor will
show whether the gasoline flows to the float
chamber, for if it is present it will spurt out of
the opening through which the priming stem
passes. If the air inlet is so arranged as to permit
it, gasoline dropping out of it when the carburetor
is primed excessively indicates that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
liquid flows out of the spray nozzle, this part
thus being shown to be clear. If no gasoline
shows around the priming stem, the feed pipe
or float valve may be suspected of being clogged,
it being taken for granted that there is gasoline
in the tank and that the supply cock is open.
If it is found that gasoline is present in the
air inlet, and that the carburetor is damp with
it when the primer has not been touched, it
indicates that the float chamber is flooded; the
carburetor should be taken apart for inspection
and thorough cleaning.</p>


<h3>ENGINE WILL NOT START</h3>

<p>When the engine will not start on cranking
it eight times or so, it is useless to continue to
crank it, for there is every reason to believe that
something is wrong. Too often the difficulty
is in forgetting to switch on the ignition circuit
or to open the gasoline feed. Cranking the
engine slowly will not reduce the pressure in
the inlet pipe sufficiently to draw out of the
spray nozzle the quantity of gasoline required
to form an inflammable mixture; quick cranking
is necessary. Too much priming will result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
in the formation of a rich mixture; the gasoline
should be permitted to evaporate, or the carburetor
drained, and then primed gently.</p>

<p>The failure of an engine to start on a cold
day may be due to the slowness with which
gasoline evaporates when chilled. As it is obviously
most unwise to heat the carburetor
with a flame, the best thing to do in such a
case is to pack it with cloths soaked with hot
water. A little gasoline squirted into the air
inlet, or cotton waste soaked with gasoline and
held over the same opening, will almost always
permit the engine to be started; another method
is to squirt a few drops of gasoline into the
cylinders through the relief cocks.</p>


<h3>ENGINE DOES NOT DELIVER FULL POWER</h3>

<p>Regularly occurring explosions indicate that
the cylinders are receiving the proper quantity
of mixture, and that the ignition is operating
correctly. If under these conditions the engine
fails to deliver full power, which is shown by the
sluggish running of the car, the trouble may be
identified as the result of a condition by which
power is absorbed between the engine and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
wheels. This may be from a slipping clutch,
binding brakes, or tight bearings, these more
probably on the wheels than on the change-speed
mechanism or drive.</p>

<p>The brake rods may get out of adjustment,
or the spring stick, with the result that the
bands or shoes are in continual contact with
the drums. A simple test for the condition of
the brakes is to push the car across the floor
by hand; it is not difficult to recognize unusual
stiffness. This test also applies to the wheel
bearings. Engine or transmission bearings that
are too tight will heat, and a touch of the hand
will show the presence of this condition. A
tight bearing should be permitted to cool before
readjusting it and proceeding.</p>


<h3>WEAK EXPLOSIONS</h3>

<p>Regular but weak explosions may be due to
too rich or too poor a mixture, or to the escape
of compression. Cranking the engine twice
will produce a compression stroke in each of
the four cylinders, and if there is a leak, the
ease with which the piston in which it occurs
may be pulled over dead center will show its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
presence. A little soapy water around the
spark plug, relief cock, or other opening into
the combustion space will show the escape of
compression in the formation of bubbles. A
hiss inside of the cylinder indicates a leaky
piston ring, or that the openings of the rings
are in line, and when this sound is sharp and
clear, the presence of a broken ring. An additional
proof of this is the undue heating of
the crank case. If the compression is correct,
the carburetor may be readjusted to improve
the quality of the mixture. A poor mixture
may be due to the partial clogging of the spray
nozzle or its passages, and a rich mixture to
the choking of the air inlet by dirt or dust, this
being especially liable to occur when the part
is oily.</p>


<h3>MISSING EXPLOSIONS</h3>

<p>The missing of explosions is a common failing
of automobile engines, and while it may be due
to a variety of causes, the most usual is that
the spark does not pass. It is not always an
easy matter to determine which of the cylinders
is missing; if the missing is constant, the coolness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
of the exhaust pipe of one as compared
to the others locates the fault. If the missing
is not constant, the difference in temperature
will not be noticeable, but the one at fault may
be located by holding down all of the vibrators
but one. If the cylinder corresponding to the
free vibrator runs steadily, its vibrator may be
held down and another released, this being
continued until the faulty cylinder is located.
The condition of the secondary circuit of this
cylinder may be ascertained by disconnecting
the secondary wire from the plug, and holding it
about a half inch away from the plug terminal
while the engine is cranked. If no spark passes
when the timer makes contact, the trouble is
in either the wire or the coil; if a spark shows,
it should be of good strength, for a current that
will produce a fair spark in the open may not
have sufficient strength to produce a like result
when under compression. If a good spark
shows, the spark plug may be suspected of
being fouled and thus short-circuited, of having
a breakdown in its insulation, or of there being
too great a distance between its points. The
threads wear a little each time that a spark plug<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
is removed from the cylinder, and in order to
retain a gas-tight joint it is best not to unscrew
the plug unless it is necessary.</p>

<p>If the secondary circuit is proven to be in
good condition, attention should be paid to the
carburetor, for a poor mixture, or water in
the gasoline, will cause the engine to miss. A
badly fitting exhaust valve will permit the
burned gases to be drawn back into the cylinder,
the fresh charge thus being weakened, and as
the valve will shift around on its seat, this may
happen irregularly. Missing will also be caused
by a weak or broken inlet-valve spring, or by
the sticking of the inlet valve, these conditions
resulting in failure to retain the mixture in the
combustion space during the compression stroke.
This pushing back into the inlet pipe of the
charge will usually produce a popping or gurgling
noise that is easily recognized.</p>


<h3>MISSING AT HIGH SPEED</h3>

<p>If an engine runs well at low speed, but misses
when speeded up, the trouble may be due to
weak battery, stuck vibrator blade, or loose
connections. A battery that will produce a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
good spark at low engine speed may not be
able to respond to the greatly increased demands
of high speed, and similarly, at low speed
the period during which the timer holds the
circuit closed is longer than at high speed, and
the vibrator has more time to get into action
before the circuit is broken. A loose connection
may be so shaken by the vibrations of high
speed as to break the circuit.</p>


<h3>ENGINE STARTS WELL, BUT COMES TO A STOP</h3>

<p>If the battery is nearly exhausted, it will
recuperate during a rest to such an extent that
it will produce good sparks, but as its condition
of strength is only temporary, the engine will
slow down and come to a stop as the current
fails. This action of the engine may also be
due to carburetor defects by which the vibrations
of running either cause the flooding of
the float chamber or the clogging of the spray
nozzle, the mixture in both cases becoming
noninflammable; the condition will also result
from an air-bound supply tank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>


<h3>OVERHEATING</h3>

<p>It sometimes happens that the engine will
continue to run after the ignition circuit is
opened. This may be due to a failure of the
water circulation, which is indicated by the
low temperature of the radiator, or by the low
speed or stopping of the fan from a slipping
or broken belt. If the cooling system is working
properly, the lubrication must be investigated.
If the oil is flowing as it should, the
cause will be found in the formation of a carbon
deposit in the combustion space, fine points of
which will become incandescent and ignite the
mixture as it passes into the cylinder or as it
is compressed. A more unlikely fault may be
that the points of the spark plug are fine enough
to become heated in a similar manner; modern
plugs are made with points of such size that this
possibility need hardly be considered. This ignition
of the mixture by other cause than the
proper spark is termed <b>preignition</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>


<h3>ENGINE COMES TO A STOP</h3>

<p>If the engine stops suddenly, the fault will
be found in the accidental opening of the switch,
or the breaking of a wire or connection. An
abrupt stop cannot be caused by anything but
an interruption of the ignition circuit, for the
cessation of the gasoline feed will bring the
engine to a stop slowly, the gasoline in the
float chamber and spray nozzle being sufficient
to permit weakened explosions before the supply
entirely fails. A slow stopping of the engine
from causes other than those previously mentioned
may be laid to defective gasoline feed,
the emptying of the tank, the clogging of the
supply pipe, float valve, or spray nozzle, or the
closing of the supply cock from jolts and vibrations.</p>

<p>If the engine comes to a stop when there
appears to be no fault with the explosions, the
cooling or lubricating systems may be at fault,
resulting in the heating of the cylinder to such
an extent that the piston sticks or seizes. Excessive
heat is proof of this, the burning or
“frying” of excess oil on the outside of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
cylinder being an early warning. A seized
piston may be freed by injecting kerosene into
the cylinder, and cranking, the cylinder first
being given time to cool.</p>


<h3>NOISES</h3>

<p>The noises made by the engine when operating
properly become so familiar to the careful
automobilist that any other sound is recognized
more by instinct than by attention. Faults
will often make themselves known by noises,
and these may be broadly classified as pounds
or knocks, hisses, squeaks, and rattles. A
pound that occurs regularly may be due to a
loose connecting rod or wrist-pin bearing, and
in this case will be heard once to every two
revolutions of the crank shaft. A pound that
occurs oftener than this may be set down as a
loose crank-shaft bearing, or a loose or cracked
fly wheel. If often happens that a fly wheel
in this condition <b>will</b> make itself heard, while
sufficiently tight to show no sign of the defect
on casual inspection.</p>

<p>A hard metallic pound is caused by the combustion
of the charge before the completion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
of the compression stroke; this condition may
result from preignition or from the spark being
too far advanced. If the latter is the case,
retarding the spark will stop the pounding.</p>

<p>Hisses are due to leaks in the combustion
space, as already described.</p>

<p>Squeaks indicate a dry bearing, or a lack of
lubrication in one of the moving parts. The
bearing may be detected by its heat. A squeak
of the leaves of a spring will often be difficult
to trace and locate, because of its irregularity.</p>

<p>Rattles indicate that something is loose, and
should be located without loss of time. All
nuts and bolts should not only be tight, but in
addition secured in position by the use of lock
nuts or cotter pins.</p>

<p>Backfiring, which is an explosion of the mixture
in the inlet pipe or carburetor, may be due
to a stuck inlet valve that permits flame to pass
and ignite the mixture before it reaches the
combustion space, but more probably either to
ignition occurring so late that combustion is
still occurring when the inlet valve opens, or to
preignition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>Explosions in the exhaust pipe or muffler are
due to the presence of unburned mixture, which
is passed out of the exhaust valve after ignition
has failed, and ignited by the heat of the exhaust
pipe, or by the hot gases from the next
explosion.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br><br>
<span class="fs80">MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In order that an automobile may be maintained
at its highest efficiency, a constant
watch must be kept over all of its parts,
and repairs and replacements made as soon as
the necessity is apparent. A worn bearing or
loose part may continue to operate, but the
wear will be far greater than would occur under
normal conditions, and may result in serious
breakage. A system of inspection to be gone
through every time that the car is used will
keep the driver informed as to its condition,
and it is best to form the habit of doing this
at the end of a run rather than before, for
then the necessity for making readjustments or
repairs will be fresh on the mind.</p>


<h3>INSPECTION</h3>

<p>The condition of the ignition circuit and of
the compression will be shown in revolving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
crank shaft twice, and the action of the carburetor
may be ascertained at the same time.
Pushing the car across the floor will show the
presence of tight brakes or wheel bearings, and
the tires may then be examined for cuts. Beginning
at the front of the car, every bearing
not fed by the lubricator should be oiled, and
all grease cups given a slight turn, those that
are empty or nearly so being filled. While this
is being done, a watch may be kept for nuts
and bolts that may have been loosened by the
vibrations.</p>


<h3>WASHING</h3>

<p>The car should be washed with clear, cold
water only, and mud floated off; to remove
mud by rubbing or any other method than
sluicing it away by the action of a gentle stream
of water will scratch the varnish and ruin the
appearance of the car. When clean, the varnished
parts may be dried with chamois or wash
leather, and the finish retained by a light coating
of a good furniture polish, which is to be
immediately dried by rubbing.</p>

<p>The tires may be cleaned by sponging, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
water should not be allowed to settle in the
bead. On cars having the gravity system of
gasoline feed, the water should not be permitted
to splash on the tank, for it will enter
through the vent. Water should also be kept
from the upholstery, for if it enters the folds
and buttonholes it will cause rotting.</p>


<h3>THE TIRES</h3>

<p>Light and heat are the worst enemies of
rubber; spare tires should be kept in a cool,
dark place, and protected from dust and moisture.
French chalk, or some similar preparation,
should be well dusted over the shoes and
tubes, and if the tubes are folded, they should
occasionally be opened and refolded in fresh
places, to prevent the formation of creases.
The spare tire that is carried on the car should
be kept in a casing, and because a dark surface
will absorb more heat than a light, the casing
should be tan, gray, or white rather than black.
The casing should be as proof as possible against
moisture, but for safety should occasionally be
removed and aired. The position of the shoe
in the holders should be changed every little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
while, in order that the straps may not cut into
the bead.</p>

<p>The tires on the wheels should receive care,
and when the car is left standing, it should be
in the shade whenever possible, to protect them
from the deleterious action of the sunlight in
hardening the rubber. They should frequently
be examined, and any cuts filled with strong
cement, for otherwise water and sand will work
in to form blisters and to separate the layers
of fabric from the rubber. The cutting of tires
can be reduced by withdrawing the clutch when
crossing broken stones, the car coasting over
them; driving the car over such a surface will
force the tires against the sharp edges, and
cutting will result more surely than when the
tire rolls over them.</p>


<h3>CARE OF THE ENGINE</h3>

<p>The carbon deposits that will form in the
combustion space will in time tend to stick the
piston rings in their grooves, and this may be
prevented by squirting a few drops of kerosene
oil into the cylinders and cranking the engine
to distribute it. This should be done at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
end of a run, and the engine permitted to stand
in that condition. The first explosions will
vaporize the kerosene and drive it off unless
too much has been used, when there will be
a tendency to foul the spark plugs.</p>

<p>The lubricating oil should be drained out of
the crank case every five hundred miles, and
the case washed out with kerosene before refilling
it with fresh oil. Gasoline has too great
a cutting action to warrant its use for this, as
it cleans down to the bare metal, while kerosene
removes the dirt and grease, leaving a good surface.
The case should be filled with oil to such
a depth that the connecting rods will dip into
it from a half-inch to an inch.</p>

<p>The same should be done with the change-speed
gear case every thousand to fifteen hundred
miles, for the particles of metal that will
be ground from the gears will injure the teeth
and bearings. In refilling, the smallest gear
should project about an inch into the oil. If
the differential is packed in grease, it will run
for an entire season with one filling, but if it
runs in oil it should be cleaned and washed two
or three times a year. The bevel gear case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
a shaft-driven car should receive the same
attention.</p>


<h3>CARE OF CHAINS</h3>

<p>Properly lubricated chains should run for at
least a thousand miles without attention. Because
of their exposed position they should be
protected against undue wear, and this is best
attained by soaking them, when thoroughly
cleaned, in melted tallow, working each joint
in order that the liquid may penetrate. The
chain should be hung up to cool and dry, the
surplus tallow being wiped off. The hardened
tallow in the joints will prevent grit from working
in, and is a lubricant as well. To clean a
chain, soak it in kerosene, working each joint
to remove the grit. The stretching of the chain
may be taken up by lengthening the radius
rods, but when the stretching reaches a point
that permits it, the chain should be shortened by
the removal of a link, and the rods readjusted.
If a complete chain is not carried as a spare
part, the kit should always include a few extra
links for emergency repairs. These are not
difficult to apply, being secured in position by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
nuts instead of by burring over the ends of the
rivets.</p>


<h3>VALVE GRINDING</h3>

<p>To grind a pitted or worn mechanically
operated valve, the pressure should be released
by compressing the spring and removing the
key or other device by which it is held in place.
On removing the plug over the valve pocket,
the upper surface of the valve disk will be exposed,
and it will be found to be provided with
a slot. While many grinding pastes may be
purchased, good results will be obtained by
mixing machine oil with flour of emery until
it is thick. Plugging the opening from the
valve pocket to the combustion space with
cotton waste to prevent the paste from entering
the cylinder, spread it on the valve disk and
seat, and rotate the disk on its seat with a screwdriver,
preferably by means of a bit brace.
Every little while the disk should be lifted and
replaced on the seat in a new position, in order
to distribute the wear evenly, and the grinding
continued until a smooth surface shows all
around both disk and seat. It is not necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
to smooth the entire surface of the disk and seat,
for the pressure will be retained by a narrower
surface.</p>

<p>An automatic valve may be removed from
the cylinder by unscrewing or unbolting its cage,
and after releasing the spring the cage may be
held in a vise while the grinding is performed.</p>

<p>After grinding, all traces of the paste should
be removed by washing with gasoline, for any
particles that remain will cause rapid wear.
When replacing the spring, that of the mechanically
operated valve will be found difficult to
compress to the point at which the key or washer
may be slipped into position, and to simplify
this many engines are built with a knob or boss
on the cylinder to serve as a fulcrum by which
a forked lever may be used. If this is not the
case, the spring may be sufficiently compressed
in a vise, and bound endwise with wire to retain
it, the wire being cut when the spring and key
are in position.</p>


<h3>CARE OF STEERING MECHANISM</h3>

<p>A failure of the steering mechanism will cause
a wreck more surely and quickly than the breakdown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
of any other part of the car, and the best
protection is absolute knowledge that it is in
perfect condition. All joints should be kept
well lubricated, and protected from dust; the
leather protectors that are furnished do not
accomplish this any too well, but they are much
better than nothing, and if the joints are packed
with grease before applying them, the results
will be good. While guarding against stiffness,
there should be very little play or lost motion
in the mechanism, and the parts should be frequently
examined for bent rods and loose joints.
A bend in the drag link or steering knuckles will
throw the front wheels out of true, in which
case the tires will be badly worn. When going
straight ahead, the wheels should be parallel;
if this is the case, the angles of the steering
arms will give the proper track when making
a turn.</p>


<h3>CARE OF SPRINGS</h3>

<p>The springs of an automobile are in constant
motion, and should be as carefully lubricated
as the other parts of a car. The spring hangers
by which the two halves of a full elliptic spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
are joined, or by which a half elliptic spring is
attached to the frame, are often provided with
grease cups, but in the absence of these the
parts should be frequently oiled. Once a
season fresh lubricant should be applied to
them. The leaves of a spring may usually be
separated enough for this by jacking up the
body, applying the jack to the frame; the springs
will thus be relieved of the weight, and the
leaves will separate sufficiently to permit heavy
grease or graphite to be introduced between
them by means of a table knife. If the springs
are too heavy to permit this, they must be taken
apart, which may be done by removing them
from the car and releasing the clips by which
they are held together. In reassembling a
spring, it may be clamped in a vise, when the
clip may easily be secured.</p>


<h3>ADJUSTING VIBRATORS</h3>

<p>In adjusting the vibrators, the best guide is
the running of the engine. The musical tone
that they make is misleading, for a difference
in the steel of which the blades are made, or in
the quality of the core, will produce a difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
in the tone, and because two vibrators sound
alike is not proof that they are producing equal
secondary sparks. With a one-cylinder engine,
the adjusting screw may be turned until the
engine is running at its best, while at the same
time there is the smallest spark between the
vibrator contacts. The adjustment of the vibrators
of a multicylinder engine is proceeded
with along similar lines, all of the blades but
one being held down, while the free blade is
adjusted until the best results are obtained in
the operation of the cylinder to which it corresponds,
and the smallness of the spark between
the vibrator contacts. When one is correct, it
is held down and another released, this process
being continued until all are adjusted.</p>


<h3>MATCHING COILS</h3>

<p>When coil boxes are so built that the units
may be removed conveniently, as is usually the
case, it often happens that the running of an
engine may be improved by matching the coils
and cylinders. A difference in the compression
in one cylinder will often cause it to run better
on one coil than on another, for no two coils<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
will give identical results. Taking each cylinder
in turn, and transposing the coil units in the
box, the effect of each coil may be noted, and
a combination found that will improve the
operation of the engine.</p>


<h3>ADJUSTING THE CARBURETOR</h3>

<p>When adjusting a carburetor, it must be remembered
that the proportion of liquid gasoline
to air in a correct mixture is very small;
because this is not well understood, a rich mixture
is present far more commonly than a poor
one. To begin at the beginning, close both the
gasoline and auxiliary air inlets, and opening
the gasoline adjustment a very little at a time,
crank the engine with the relief cocks open
until combustion is secured, the spark being retarded
and the throttle nearly closed. When
the engine runs, note the color of the flame that
shoots out of the relief cocks. A poor mixture
will produce a yellow flame, and a rich mixture
a red and smoky flame, with black smoke at the
exhaust and a smell of gasoline. The flame
of a correct mixture is blue and hardly visible.
On securing a correct mixture at low speed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
advance the spark and open the throttle to speed
up the engine, and the mixture will at once
become too rich. Adjusting the auxiliary air
inlet by weakening the tension of its spring
will bring the mixture to approximately correct
proportions. A more careful adjustment under
road conditions can be obtained by adjusting
the air inlet while the car is being operated, for
the position of the carburetor is usually such
that this may be done while standing or kneeling
on the running board.</p>

<p>Faulty adjustment of the carburetor is often
suspected when the real source is in the throttle
or governor connections. The bending of a
rod connecting the throttle with either the foot,
hand, or governor control, or the wear of the
joints, will throw the carburetor out, and the
possible failure of these parts must be borne
in mind accordingly.</p>


<h3>SETTING THE VALVES</h3>

<p>In setting or timing the valves of a gasoline
engine, the point to be considered is the closing
of the exhaust valve, for upon this good results
depend. If this valve is held open too long, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
burned gases driven out will be drawn back into
the cylinder, and if it closes too soon the greatest
possible quantity of burned gases will not have
been expelled. The many experiments carried
on by the manufacturers, and the attention that
they must pay to this point, result in the delivery
of cars with valves correctly timed, and usually
with marks made on the two-to-one gears to
guide in resetting them. In the absence of these
guides, the setting of valves need not be difficult,
although experimenting is required to secure
the best results. The first step is to locate the
position of the piston in the cylinder. There is
always an opening in the cylinder head—a relief
valve, the spark-plug opening, or other—and a
stiff wire may be dropped through it, with its
lower end resting on the piston and its upper
end projecting. As the piston is moved by
cranking the engine, the wire will move with it,
and is to be marked with a file at its highest
and lowest positions. While no fixed rule can
be laid down, it may be said that in general
the exhaust valve should close when the piston
has made from 1/64 to 1/32 inch of its outward
stroke. The two-to-one gears having been unmeshed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
the cam shaft may be revolved in its
bearings by hand; cranking slowly, move the
piston down from its highest point to that at
which the exhaust should close, and hold it
there. Revolve the cam shaft until the nose of
the cam is passing from under the roller of
the valve-lifter rod, and the valve just closed.
This point may be accurately ascertained by
placing a strip of thin paper between the valve-lifter
rod and valve stem; when the cam is
acting on the valve-lifter rod, the paper will be
pinched, but the seating of the valve will release
it. When the paper can be pulled out,
mesh the two-to-one gears, and the relations
thus established between the crank and the cam
shafts will be maintained. Cranking the engine
a few times, using the strip of paper, will verify
results, and the engine may then be started and
the effect noted. If the running is not satisfactory,
unmesh the gears, and mesh them with
a difference of one tooth, first one way and then
the other, noting results, and retaining the most
satisfactory position. Cams are often cut in
one piece with the cam shaft, and the gear
keyed on the end; there is therefore no chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
to make a finer adjustment than what is permitted
by shifting the gears one tooth at a
time. On multicylinder engines, one cam shaft
operates all of the exhaust valves, and the
setting of one valve sets all.</p>

<p>When inlet valves are of the mechanically
operated type, but controlled by a separate
cam shaft, this must be set in a similar manner.
The nose of the cam should just be coming into
contact with the push rod roller at the instant
when the exhaust valve is completely closed.
This should occur as the piston begins to move
outward on the inlet stroke, the exact position
being determined by experiment.</p>

<p>When the cams are so badly worn that if
they are set to open correctly they close too
soon, the best remedy is a set of new cams;
for while the brazing of a strip of brass to the
sides of the cams can be resorted to, the result
is only temporary at best, and not as accurate
as that secured by the use of new cams.</p>

<p>While the tension of the spring of an automatic
valve is sometimes controlled by a nut,
its adjustment usually depends on the stretching
of the spring to strengthen it, or the cutting off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
of part of a turn to weaken it. The tension
should be adjusted, one cylinder at a time,
until the best results from each are secured.</p>


<h3>THE WIRING</h3>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image237" style="max-width: 46.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image237.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.—Jump Spark Wiring Diagrams.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In laying the wires for the ignition system,
only the best wire should be used, and all contacts
should be bright and clean. Connections
should be tight, and covered with vaseline to
prevent corrosion, additional protection being
secured by binding all exposed places with so-called
electric tape. There should be the fullest
protection against chafing and moisture, and
no sagging of the wires. Beginning with the
battery, the cells should be placed in a box that
holds them securely, so that there may be no
jolting, for this in working the wires will tend
to loosen the connections. In connecting the
cells, the wires should be cut to correct length,
but not so short that they will be drawn tight
when connected. The insulation should be cut
off cleanly, and the paraffin that will cling to
the metal scraped off. The ground wire may
then be run, after which the wires from the
two batteries may be connected to the switch.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>(Fig. 50). On multicylinder engines, one circuit
should be completed and tested before another
is started, as this obviates the danger of confusing
the wires. The primary wire should be
run from a coil unit to its timer contact, making
sure by the buzzing of the vibrator that the
current flows when the switch is closed. A buzz
of the vibrator when the timer is not making
contact indicates a short circuit. The primary
circuit for the coil having been correctly arranged,
the secondary connection should be
made and tested before laying the primary of
the next coil unit. In making the timer contacts
of a four-cylinder engine the firing order
as established by the opening of the exhaust
valves must be kept in mind. With the spark
control lever in the retarded position, the timer
should be set so that it is just beginning to
make a contact when the piston in cylinder No.
1 is at top dead center of the compression
stroke. This contact should then be connected
to the primary terminal of the first coil, and the
secondary of that coil connected to the spark
plug. If the firing order is 1, 2, 4, 3, (Fig. 51),
cylinder No. 2 will be the next to fire, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>primary of coil 2 should be connected to the
next timer contact in the direction of rotation.
As the next cylinder to fire will be No. 4, the
timer contact that will next be reached should
be connected to coil No. 4, the remaining contact
point being connected to coil No. 2. In the
diagram the timer is supposed to be moving in
the same direction as the hands of a watch.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image239" style="max-width: 46.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image239.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.—Jump Spark Wiring Diagrams.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>There is no difference in the wiring of a horizontal
double-opposed and a two-cylinder vertical
180° crank-shaft engine, as shown in Fig.
50, except that the timers are so built that in
the first the two contacts are a quarter revolution
apart, and in the second a half revolution.</p>

<p>In wiring a car with a single coil and secondary
distributer the four contacts of the timer
all lead to the primary terminal of the coil, the
firing order being according to the manner in
which the secondary terminals of the distributer
are connected to the cylinders (Fig. 51).</p>

<p>Wiring for the make-and-break system is
much simpler than that of the jump-spark, and
when a magneto alone is used, it consists, as
will be seen from Fig. 52, of only a wire from the
magneto to the igniters, the other terminal of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>the magneto being attached to its metal base
in such a manner that the ground connection
is made when the magneto is secured in position
on the engine. The firing order is according to
the setting of the cams that operate the igniter
tappets.</p>

<h3>GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h3>

<p>The red-painted toy magnet that is one of the
properties of childhood and with which everyone is
familiar, may well be used as the beginning of a
study of the magneto, for with it the characteristics
of magnetism may be observed. A little experimenting
will show that the magnet will attract, or
“pick up”, iron and steel objects only, having no
effect on copper, brass, lead, wood, or, for practical
purposes, any other substance. Furthermore, it illustrates
the fact that when iron and steel are in
contact with it, they in turn become magnetic, able
also to attract tacks and other bits of the same metals.
Iron, however, is shown by experiment to be
magnetic only when in actual contact with the magnet,
losing its magnetism as soon as the contact is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
broken, while when steel is magnetized by touching
it to a magnet it remains magnetic. This
fact is illustrated by the magnet itself, which is of
steel and therefore capable of retaining its power
for a greater or less time, depending on its quality
and hardness.</p>

</div>

<p>If iron filings are scattered on a piece of paper
laid over a magnet they will not fall evenly and
regularly, but will collect most thickly
at the ends, or poles, of the magnet,
showing that there the magnetic attraction
is stronger than at any other points.
If the filings are examined closely it
will be seen that they have taken up
definite positions, forming lines and
curves extending between the two poles
(Fig. 1). This is the simplest method
by which the magnetism may be made visible, and
it illustrates the fact that the power of a magnet
acts in a series of lines passing from one pole to the
other. If a piece of iron or steel is placed across
the poles of a magnet these lines, or as many of
them as possible, will use it as a bridge or conductor,
because they can pass through it more
easily than through air. Such a piece of iron or
steel is called a keeper, and by its use the magnet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
will retain its strength for a much greater time
than if the lines are obliged to make their way
through the far greater resistance that the air
presents to their passage.</p>

<p>These lines, which are known as <b>magnetic lines
of force</b>, always move in the same direction, passing
through the air or the keeper from the north
pole of the magnet to the south pole, and passing
through the metal of the magnet itself from the
south pole to the north pole.</p>

<p>The strength of a magnet depends on the number
of these lines of magnetic force that it possesses.
If two magnets, one strong and the other weak, are
placed under sheets of paper on which iron filings
are scattered, their comparative strengths are clearly
shown by the difference in the number of lines of
force that the filings show them to possess.</p>

<p>The space through which a magnet makes itself
felt is known as the <b>magnetic field</b>, and this is
large or small, according to the number of lines
of force. The stronger the magnet, the larger will
be the sweep of the curves of its lines of force,
and the greater will be the field that they form.</p>

<p>When a piece of iron or steel is placed in contact
with a magnet, the lines of force flow into it, and
it becomes magnetized, throwing out lines of force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
and forming its own magnetic field, which is quite
distinct from the magnetic field of the original
magnet. If the piece is of iron, its lines of force
and its field die away as soon as it is separated from
the magnet, but a piece of steel once magnetized
will retain its magnetism and, of course, its lines of
force.</p>

<p>A wire of nonmagnetic metal, such as copper,
for instance, will not have the slightest attraction
for iron filings, but when an electric current is
passed through it the filings will act as if the copper
were a magnet, clinging to it as long as the current
passes, and dropping as soon as the circuit is
broken. As a matter of fact, an electric current
sets up lines of magnetic force exactly similar to
those of a permanent magnet, their number being
in proportion to the strength of the current.</p>

<p>As has been stated, iron becomes magnetized
when magnetic lines of force flow into it. If, therefore,
a wire through which an electric current
passes is wound around an iron rod, the lines of
force set up by the current will pass into the rod
and magnetize it, so that it sets up its own magnetic
field. This magnetic field is created when the electric
current starts flowing in the wire and dies out
when the flow of the current is stopped, for then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
the lines of force due to the current die out, and
the iron, which depends on them for its magnetism
and which has not the ability to retain its lines of
force, returns to its original nonmagnetic condition.
An arrangement of this sort, consisting of a
soft iron core, around which is wound a number
of layers of insulated wire, forms an <b>electro-magnet</b>,
and will produce a magnetic field whenever
an electric current passes through the wire. The
action is practically instantaneous, the magnetic
field appearing and dying out on the making and
breaking of the electric circuit.</p>

<p>A magnetic field may thus be produced by the
action of an electric current, and an electric current
in turn may be produced by the action of a magnetic
field. To generate a current by this method
it is only necessary to place a conductor forming a
closed circuit in a magnetic field, and to change the
strength of the field, making it stronger or weaker.
For an example, a length of insulated wire may be
wound on an iron bar, and the bar then touched
with a magnet. As soon as the lines of force flow
into the bar it becomes magnetized and sets up a
magnetic field in which the lines of force follow
the law and flow from one pole to the other through
the air. The formation of this field is exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
rapid, but during the time that the field is forming
and increasing to its full strength, an electric current
will flow in the wire winding. When the field
has reached its full strength, the flow of the current
ceases. On separating the bar from the magnet it
loses its magnetism, and the field set up by it dies
away; or in other words, its strength undergoes
another change, now growing weaker as the bar
returns to a nonmagnetic condition. This dying
out of the field generates another momentary flow
of current in the wire, which moves in the direction
opposite to the flow of the current generated while
the strength of the field was increasing.</p>

<p>The current generated is called an <b>induced current</b>,
and the method of producing it is called <b>induction</b>.</p>

<p>The intensity of the induced current in any given
winding depends on the extent of the change in
the strength of the field and upon the rapidity with
which it occurs. A bar of iron is limited as to the
strength to which it can be magnetized; or in other
words, it can only set up a limited number of lines
of force. Increasing the strength of the field from
nothing to this point, or reducing its strength from
this point to nothing, gives the greatest change in
strength possible to obtain, and if this change occurs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
in the shortest possible time, then the current induced
will be of the greatest intensity that can be
obtained from a conductor of the size and length
used.</p>

<p>For an understanding of the action of a magneto
it is necessary to bear in mind the following points:</p>

<p>First. That a magnetic field is composed of lines
of magnetic force that flow from one pole of the
magnet to the other.</p>

<p>Second. That the lines of force will take the path
that presents the least resistance.</p>

<p>Third. That an electric current will be generated,
or induced, in a conductor placed in a magnetic
field whenever the strength of the field changes.</p>

<p>Fourth. That the current flows only while the
change in strength is taking place, ceasing to exist
when the field becomes uniformly strong or weak.</p>

<p>To make a practical application of the laws governing
the production of an induced current, a conductor
forming a closed circuit is placed in a magnetic
field, and the strength of the field caused to
change, alternately becoming strong and weak. In
magnetos, the magnetic field is due to two or more
powerful steel magnets, and the conductor, a length
of insulated copper wire, is wound on a soft iron
core and revolved between the poles of the magnets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
where the field is strongest. The magnets are
known as the <b>field</b> of the magneto, and the wire
on its core the <b>armature</b>. The shape of the iron
armature core is shown in
Fig. 2, the winding being
indicated by heavy black
lines. On the inside of the
poles of the field are <b>pole
pieces</b>, which are blocks of
soft iron hollowed out to receive the armature.
As the successful operation of the magneto requires
the lines of force to have as easy a path as
possible, the air space between the armature heads
and pole pieces is very
small, being in the neighborhood
of 1/100 of an inch.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp20" id="image256a" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image256a.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.—Armature.</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="figright illowp40" id="image256b" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image256b.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>When the armature is not
in position, the lines of
force will be required to
pass from one pole piece
to the other through the
air, and as they will seek
the path of lowest resistance, most of them will
pass between the lower points of the pole pieces,
where the air gap is short, and where the lines of
force are present in the greatest number (Fig. 3).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
When the armature is placed between the pole
pieces, however, it gives the lines of force a path of
still lower resistance, and they will therefore follow
it, whatever its position may be. If the armature
is free to turn, it will take a horizontal position, as
shown in Fig. 4, for then the heads are entirely
in contact with the pole pieces, and the greatest possible
number of lines of force can take the path
offered by the neck of the armature.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp40" id="image257a" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image257a.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="figright illowp40" id="image257b" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image257b.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>When the armature is in this position, the neck
is magnetized by the flow of lines of force through
it and sets up a powerful magnetic field which is
quite distinct from the field thrown out by the field
magnets. If the armature is revolved, it takes the
lines of force, or most of them, with it, and they
continue to flow through the neck as long as one
head of the armature is in contact with the north<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
pole piece and the other head in contact with the
south pole piece, for even this long and distorted
path, as shown in Fig. 5, is of less resistance than
the air gap. The lines of force, however, resist this
lengthening of their path, and tend to hold the
armature with the neck horizontal, when their passage
is easiest. If the armature is turned by hand,
it will be noticed that it becomes harder to turn as
the neck approaches the
vertical position, and if the
magnets are sufficiently
powerful, a great effort
will be necessary. Once
vertical, however, the armature
hangs, and a still
greater effort is required
to continue the revolution,
for the lines of force have found new paths of
low resistance (Fig. 6). Each armature head now
forms a bridge between the pole pieces, and the
lines of force divide, some going through the
upper head and some through the lower. The lines
entirely abandon the neck, and in consequence its
magnetic field dies out. When these paths are
broken by continuing the revolution of the armature,
the lines of force again flow through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
neck, and its magnetic field is again established
(Fig. 7). This action occurs twice during each
complete revolution of the armature, and if the
armature is revolved by hand, the two points when
the neck is horizontal and the movement easy will
be very distinct from the hard points when the
neck is going over the vertical
position.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp40" id="image258" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image258.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="figright illowp40" id="image259" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image259.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In one revolution the neck
is twice magnetized and
demagnetized; or in other
words, the magnetic field
set up by the neck as the
lines of force pass through
it twice changes its strength,
being strong when the neck is horizontal and weak
when it is vertical. The winding on the armature
is affected by this magnetic field, and electric currents
are induced in it by these changes in its
strength.</p>

<p>The greatest change in the strength of the field
occurs as the armature moves into the vertical position,
when its heads form bridges between the
two pole pieces (Fig. 6). Up to this point the armature
neck is strongly magnetized, but its magnetic
field dies out as the neck becomes vertical. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
at this point then that the induced current is at its
greatest intensity and becomes sufficient for ignition
purposes.</p>

<p>In making an armature the channels are wound
full of wire, and this is retained against the action
of centrifugal force by two or three short lengths
of wire bound around the armature and lying in
grooves cut in the heads for that purpose. Disks of
brass are also screwed to the ends of the armature
core, and assist in making it dust and water proof.
The magneto must have a base, and this must be of
some nonmagnetic metal, like brass, for if it were
made of iron it would provide a convenient path for
the lines of force, and they would have no interest
in passing through the armature. There must also
be bearings for the armature shaft, and these are
either plain or ball, set in brass plates screwed to
the ends of the pole pieces. A zinc or aluminum
plate covers the space over the armature and between
the upper edges of the pole pieces, so that the
armature revolves in a tunnel that is proof against
the entrance of dust and water.</p>

<p>There are, of course, two ends to the wire wound
on the armature, but the simplicity of a magneto
is increased by grounding one end on the metal of
the armature, the other end being brought to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
single terminal (Fig. 2). The circuit is therefore
complete when this terminal is connected to any
metal part of the magneto; or, as the magneto is
mounted directly on the metal of the engine, to any
metal part of the engine or frame of the car. The
live end of the armature winding is brought out
by means of a metal rod passing lengthways
through the shaft of the armature, the rod being
insulated from the shaft by means of a hard rubber
bushing or tube. The terminal of the winding is
therefore found at one end of the armature shaft,
and the current flows from this revolving part to
the stationary binding post by means of a carbon
or steel spring that is kept pressed against the end
of this rod.</p>

<p>Magnetos are classified as L. T. (low tension)
and H. T. (high tension) according to the current
that they deliver, the word tension being used to indicate
the pressure or voltage of the current, but
more accurate expressions would be primary and
secondary magnetos. The magneto already described
is of the low-tension type, and is used for
the make-and-break ignition system, its winding being
so proportioned that at maximum speed it delivers
a current of from 100 to 150 volts. What is
often spoken of as a high-tension magneto is employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
for the jump spark system, a magneto of
the type described delivering a current that flows
through the primary winding of a secondary induction
coil; but this use of the term is erroneous, for
while the system delivers a high-tension spark, this
is from the coil. The magneto itself is not only of
the low-tension type, but its current must be so
feeble that the danger of burning out the coil is
obviated. A true high-tension magneto has two
windings on the armature; one, the primary, consisting
of a few layers of coarse wire, over which
the very great number of layers of fine wire forming
the secondary is wound. This may give a current
of from 10,000 to 20,000 volts, and is used for the
jump spark ignition system.</p>

<p>These types and their applications will be discussed
in the succeeding chapters.</p>


<h3>MAGNETOS IN GENERAL</h3>

<p>One of the great advantages resulting from the
use of a magneto is that for ordinary running it
does away with the necessity for the hand advance
of the spark. The greater the speed at which a
magneto runs, the more abrupt is the change in the
strength of the magnetic field, and in consequence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
the greater is the intensity of the current delivered.
When running at slow speed, the spark produced in
the cylinder will be weak and thin; it will be sufficient
to ignite the mixture, but the ignition will occur
slowly. At high speeds, on the contrary, the
intensity of the current produced will be such that
a flame rather than a spark will be produced, and
ignition will occur much more rapidly and positively.
When starting an engine on the magneto,
the spark control lever must be advanced more
than is necessary for ignition by battery, and the
engine must be cranked at such a speed that the
magneto will produce a current sufficient for ignition.
Once started, it is rarely necessary to move
the spark control lever, except for high speeds,
for speeding the engine up by opening the throttle
will increase the speed of the magneto, and the
flaming spark will result in a quicker ignition of
the mixture.</p>

<p>Because a magneto does not deliver a continuous
current, it cannot be driven by a belt or by friction,
for a slight slip would throw it out of time with the
engine. The best drive is by gears, for this is positive,
and there is a minimum of lost motion. In
some cases the magneto is driven by chain and
sprocket, and while this prevents slipping, there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
considerable lost motion when the chain is loose
enough to run smoothly, and the magneto cannot be
timed as accurately as is possible with gears.</p>


<h3>MAGNETO TROUBLES</h3>

<p>If the ignition fails, and the question arises as to
the reason, the condition of the magneto may be
tested quickly and in a most satisfactory manner. It
either gives a current or it does not, and to learn its
condition it is only necessary to disconnect it from
the ignition system, and to connect one end of a
length of wire to its terminal. Holding the free end
of this wire in the bare fingers of one hand, and
cranking the engine with the other hand, also bare,
a shock will be felt as the armature revolves, if it
is in good condition. If this test is too strenuous,
the free end of the wire may be held lightly against
the teeth of a gear while an assistant cranks the
engine briskly. As the wire falls from tooth to
tooth, a time will come when the point of maximum
current coincides with the breaking of the circuit
at the gear, and if the magneto is in good condition,
a flaming spark will appear.</p>

<p>There is little about a magneto of the type described
to get out of order. Oil or dirt between
the spring or brush and the end of the conducting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
rod may prevent the flow of current, or, what is
more unlikely, the wire of the armature may be
broken. The last trouble is of rare occurrence, for
when winding the wire on the armature it is shellacked,
and for all practical purposes the whole becomes
a solid mass. The only point where the wire
can break is the half-inch of it that is connected to
the inside end of the conducting rod that passes
through the shaft, and the condition of this may be
learned by removing the dust cover and looking. If
broken, a drop of solder, carefully applied, will repair
the damage.</p>

<p>A question that is frequently asked is regarding
the liability of the field magnets to lose their magnetism.
If made of the proper material, and
handled and used under proper conditions, they
should hold their magnetism indefinitely. The
strength of a toy magnet may be increased by tearing
its keeper sharply away from the poles, and as
sharply replacing it, the operation being repeated.
When the armature of a magneto revolves, it performs
the same office for the field magnets, and it
has the effect of keeping them up to strength indefinitely.
If the magneto is mishandled, however, it is
another story, and an inquisitive or careless worker
can almost instantly weaken a field by removing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
armature without taking the proper precautions.
The armature, when in position, acts as a keeper,
and provides a path of low resistance for the passage
of the lines of magnetic force. If the keeper is
taken away, the lines of force are required to traverse
the higher resistance of the air, and many of
them then being overcome, their number decreases
and the field becomes greatly weakened. This takes
place instantly on the removal of the armature. It
is rarely necessary for a chauffeur to remove the
armature of a magneto, but when it is required, the
first step is the placing of a heavy plate of iron
under the arch of the magnets, and in close metallic
contact with the pole pieces, the dust plate being removed.
This will act as a keeper, and the armature
may then be removed. If such a plate of iron
is not at hand, both of the end plates may be unscrewed
and one of them removed, and then, as the
armature is drawn out slowly, small steel tools, or
short lengths of iron rod, well cleaned, may be fed
in after it, so that the cavity is well filled. If these
precautions are taken the armature may be removed
with safety, but it is better not to attempt this, and
it is never advisable to detach the magnets from the
base or pole pieces. So much damage may be done
to a magneto by an unskilled man, that some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
manufacturers go to the length of equipping their
magnetos with seals, the breaking of which is evidence
that the machine has been tampered with, and
that someone is directly to blame if it does not deliver
current.</p>

<p>When an engine is equipped with a double system
of ignition, or when there are two sources of current,
one being a magneto, the greatest care must
be taken to prevent even the momentary flow of the
battery current through the armature winding, for
this will result in the demagnetization of the field.
The same trouble will result if the magneto current
is led through the winding of a primary induction
coil in the hope of intensifying the current. Should
the battery current flow through the armature winding,
the core would be magnetized, for it would
then be an electro-magnet, and the magnetic field
set up by the armature under such conditions would
overcome the less powerful field set up by the field
magnets and their strength would instantly be reduced.</p>

<p>It is very essential to keep the armature bearings
thoroughly lubricated in order that there may be as
little wear as possible. The clearance between the
armature heads and the pole pieces is so slight that
a trifling amount of wear in the bearings would permit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
the two to rub or strike. The best magnetos
are equipped with ball bearings, provided with wick
feeds that keep them lubricated, but even with these
the lubrication must be watched. Oil cups are provided,
which must be kept filled, but it must be remembered
that an excess of oil may make trouble in
working its way into the armature winding and
destroying the insulation. In some cases the oil
cups are provided with an overflow, which prevents
excessive oiling and the collection of surplus oil
around the bearings.</p>


<h3>LOW-TENSION IGNITION SYSTEM</h3>

<p>In utilizing the current of a magneto for ignition
purposes, the circuit is so arranged that it is first
closed and then opened, the closing of the circuit
permitting the current to flow, and the breaking of
the circuit resulting in a spark at the break. The
closing and opening of the circuit is due to the
action of the <b>igniter</b>, which is a device located in
the cylinder wall, one end projecting into the combustion
space and the outside end bearing the parts
by which it is operated. The two chief parts of
an igniter are the <b>stationary</b> and <b>movable electrodes</b>,
so arranged and connected that when the movable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
electrode comes into contact with the stationary
electrode the circuit is closed, and when it moves
out of contact the circuit is broken.</p>

<p>The stationary electrode is a steel pin or screw
passing through the cylinder wall, and carefully insulated
from it by a tube or bushing of mica or
other insulant that is proof against the heat and
pressure produced in the combustion space. The
current developed by the magneto is led to this
stationary electrode. The movable electrode rocks
in a bearing in the cylinder wall, the inside end of its
short shaft carrying a finger that touches or separates
from the stationary electrode as the shaft is
rocked. The outer end of the short shaft carries
one or two short arms by which the shaft is moved.
The operation of the igniter is due to the action of
a cam on the half-time shaft, which moves a <b>tappet
rod</b> that in turn acts on the arm controlling
the movable electrode.</p>

<p>When the cam is not acting on the tappet, the
movable electrode is held out of contact with the
stationary electrode, and there is consequently no
circuit for the current. As the tappet is moved by
the revolution of the cam, the movable electrode
is freed and is brought into contact with the stationary
electrode by the action of a light spring.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
This closes the circuit, and the current flows. The
further revolution of the cam separates the movable
electrode from the stationary, and the sudden
breaking of the circuit results in the production of
a spark between the two.</p>

<p>There is a great variety in the construction of
igniters, but the operation is the same in all. Once
in its revolution the cam operates the movable arm
of the igniter, permitting it to touch the stationary
electrode, and this establishment of the circuit is
followed by its rupture as the continued movement
of the cam causes the tappet again to operate the
movable electrode. A better spark for ignition purposes
is obtained when the movable electrode is
moved out of contact with the stationary electrode
sharply than when it is moved slowly, and for this
reason the parts are so arranged that the tappet
strikes the movable electrode a blow instead of
pushing or pressing it. This construction is shown
in Fig. 8. When the cam is not acting on the tappet,
the head on the tappet holds the movable electrode
away from the stationary, against the action
of a light spring. As the cam lifts the tappet, the
tappet head releases the movable electrode, and the
light spring draws it upward and against the stationary
electrode, establishing the circuit. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>the tappet drops off the cam, it is brought down
sharply by the tappet spring, and its head strikes
the movable electrode a sharp blow that results in
the sudden breaking of the circuit.</p>

<p>In some types, the movable electrode comes into
contact with the end of the stationary electrode,
which is then a screw, and the distance between
them may be adjusted by screwing it in or out.
In other types, contact is made with the side of
the stationary electrode, in which case the adjustment
of the distance is provided for on the movable
electrode. This distance should be about one sixteenth
of an inch, for this is ample for the production
of a satisfactory spark, and a greater distance
will result in the more rapid burning of the contact
points.</p>

<p>In multicylinder engines, the current from the
live end of the armature winding is led to a <b>bus-bar</b>
of conducting material that serves to distribute it
to the igniters. The stationary and insulated electrode
of each igniter is connected to this bus-bar
by a short length of wire that either leads through
a switch of ordinary construction, or is provided
with a plug on its end that fits into a socket on the
bus-bar and serves the purpose of a switch by
which the igniters may be thrown out of circuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
when it is desirable. As the magneto is grounded
when it is placed on the engine, and as the movable
electrode of the igniter is also grounded on the engine,
a circuit for the current is provided only when
a movable electrode is in contact with a stationary
electrode. The construction of the cam shaft is
such that only one igniter at a time makes contact,
which occurs during the compression stroke, so that
the rupturing of the circuit will occur at the point
in the compression stroke when the spark is required
for ignition.</p>

<p>To cut off the ignition circuit for the purpose
of stopping the engine, it would be bad practice
to break the contact between the magneto and the
bus-bar, for while this would bring the desired result
it might result in the injury of the magneto,
as there would then be no circuit for the current
that the magneto would still be developing. The
best practice is to short-circuit the magneto, and
this is provided for by means of a simple switch,
one point of which is grounded, and the other connected
to any insulated part of the ignition system;
the magneto terminal, bus-bar, or other. When
this switch is closed, a circuit is provided for the
magneto current, which, in the arrangement shown
in Fig. 8, flows from the magneto to the bus-bar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
to the switch (when closed), to ground, and back to
the magneto. If this circuit is provided, the current
will follow it, abandoning the paths across the igniters
as they operate, and the production of sparks
ceasing, the engine will come to a stop.</p>


<h3>SETTING UP THE L. T. SYSTEM</h3>

<p>To obtain successful results, the spark must be
produced at the correct point in the compression
stroke, and this requires such adjustment of the igniters
that the movable electrode breaks the circuit
at this point. Because the magneto delivers a fluctuating
current, it is clear that the most satisfactory
spark will be produced when it is so set that it will
be delivering its maximum current at the instant
that the igniters separate. As most of the running
of a car is done on an advanced spark, the point of
maximum advance must be determined in order to
set or adjust a low-tension ignition system. This
point varies with different engines; in a large proportion
the piston has a “lead” of one half inch,
while in a smaller number the “lead” varies from
this to three quarters of an inch. By this it is meant
that when advanced, the spark occurs when the
piston still has one half inch to travel to reach top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
dead center of the compression stroke, or anything
up to three quarters of an inch, as the case may be.
Inquiry of the manufacturers regarding this point
will secure the information, but if this is not possible,
the point may be found by experiment.</p>

<p>The first step is to bring one of the pistons to
within one half inch of top dead center of the compression
stroke. This position may be determined
by dropping a stiff wire through a compression
relief cock or other opening in the cylinder head,
so that it rests on the piston and is moved by it.
The crank shaft of a four-cycle engine must make
two revolutions to complete the cycle in one of the
cylinders, and during these two revolutions the piston
will twice pass top dead center, as will be shown
by the movements of the wire. It is necessary,
however, to distinguish between top dead center
of the compression stroke and top dead center of
the exhaust stroke, and this may be accomplished
by watching the stem of the exhaust valve. When
the wire shows that the piston is moving toward
top dead center, and the exhaust valve stem shows
the valve to be open, the piston is known to be making
the exhaust stroke, and to get it to top dead
center of the compression stroke it is necessary to
continue the revolution of the crank shaft while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
piston moves downward on the inlet stroke, and
again upward on the compression stroke. During
this second upward stroke the exhaust valve stem
will not move, showing the valve to be closed.
Cranking must stop when the lack of movement of
the wire shows the piston to be at top dead center,
and then the crank shaft must be turned backward
by means of the flywheel until the piston has
moved down one half inch. This may be determined
by making a mark on the wire and holding
a rule firmly in such a position that as the wire follows
the piston the mark will move along the graduations.
When the mark has moved down one half
inch below top dead center, the movement of the
crank shaft must be stopped so that the piston is
held in that position.</p>

<p>Place the spark control lever in the advanced
position, when the nose of the cam should be
just ceasing to act on the tappet. The movable
electrode must then be adjusted so that it is in
the act of separating from the stationary electrode,
and this is performed by shortening or
lengthening the tappet, or otherwise setting the
parts so that the tappet head is in contact with the
outside arm of the movable electrode and beginning
to move it away from the stationary electrode.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
This point may be accurately determined by the use
of an electric bell circuit. Connect a bell with
three or four dry cells, grounding the free terminal
of the battery on the engine. Then breaking any
connection between the igniter terminal and the ignition
system, connect the free terminal of the bell
to the igniter. The circuit will then consist of battery,
bell, igniter, and ground return, and the bell
will ring when the movable electrode is making
contact with the stationary. Having adjusted the
movable electrode so that it is approximately correct,
it may be tested by cranking the engine. The
bell should begin to ring during the compression
stroke, and should stop ringing when the marks of
the wire show the piston to be one half inch from
top dead center. The igniter of each cylinder must
be adjusted separately, and when tests have shown
them to be correct, the lock nuts must be set up
to hold them in position.</p>

<p>In attaching the magneto to the engine, means
must be provided for driving it at the proper speed.
In a four-cylinder engine, two revolutions of the
crank shaft are necessary for the production of a
cycle in each of the cylinders, two power strokes
occurring in each revolution. As the magneto delivers
its maximum current twice in each revolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
of the armature, it must be driven at the speed
of the crank shaft, and as the drive is usually taken
from the cam shaft, the gear on the magneto
must have half as many teeth as the gear on the
half-time shaft with which it meshes. To set the
magneto, the crank shaft should be revolved until
one of the pistons (it makes no difference which)
is in the firing position; that is, the position for
which the igniter is set to open. The armature
should then be revolved by hand until it is just past
the vertical position of Fig. 6, with about one sixty-fourth
of an inch of space showing between its
rear edge and the edge of the pole piece from which
it is moving. This can most easily be accomplished
by removing the dust cover and reaching under the
arch of the field with the fingers. Holding the armature
in this position, its driving gear should be
slipped into mesh with the gear on the half-time
shaft.</p>

<p>In some makes of magnetos the gear is keyed to
the armature shaft, which determines its position
in relation to the armature. In this case, the gears
must be meshed as close to the indicated position
as possible. In other designs the magneto is driven
by a positive clutch, so that it is impossible to mesh
it in any but the correct position. In Bosch magnetos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
there is no key, but the shaft is tapered to
fit a tapered hole in the gear, so that a very exact
setting of the magneto is possible.</p>

<p>When the gear is keyed to the armature shaft,
the closeness of the setting depends on the thickness
of the teeth; the thinner the teeth, the closer
it is possible to adjust the magneto. If the armature
gear has an uneven number of teeth, however,
it is possible to make the setting by one half the
thickness of a tooth. If it is found that the thickness
of the teeth is such that the armature cannot be
set correctly, give the armature and its gear a half
turn, when, if the number of teeth is odd, it will
be found that a tooth on one side corresponds to
the space between two teeth on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Having set the magneto and drawn up the nut
securing the gear to the armature shaft, the system
may be wired by running a wire from the terminal
of the magneto to the bus-bar, and other wires
from the bus-bar to each of the igniter terminals.
The short circuiting switch should also be connected
up, the running of its wires depending on
convenience.</p>

<p>The system installed, it should be tested. With
the system adjusted as indicated, the engine should
start, and a very short run will show if it is correct.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
If it does not respond to advancing the spark, or if
its operation is not satisfactory, a readjustment
should be made, giving the piston a lead of one
eighth of an inch more, or five eighths of an inch in
all, with the spark advanced. If this shows an
improvement, but the engine still does not develop
its full power, the operation may be repeated, the
piston being given more lead by one sixteenth of
an inch.</p>

<p>If the compression is not the same in all of the
cylinders, a closer adjustment of the igniters may
be made that will improve the operation of the engine,
the tappet of the high compression cylinder
being adjusted to operate the movable electrode
slightly before the others, so that the larger volume
of mixture will have more time in which to burn.
The switches through which the igniters are connected
to the bus-bar may now be brought into use,
and when three of them are open the engine should
run on the single cylinder of which the circuit is
complete. Testing the cylinders in this way, running
one at a time, gives an opportunity for comparing
their action, and for noting those in which the
power is weak. If the weakness is due to ignition
trouble, it may be corrected by a further adjustment
of the tappet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>


<h3>TROUBLES</h3>

<p>Failure of ignition due to magneto trouble has
already been described.</p>

<p>Any short circuit of the system will prevent ignition,
for the current will not flow across the
igniters if another path is open to it. Short circuiting
may be due to the chafing of the insulation
of the wires, to a frayed end of a stranded cable
making contact with the metal of the engine, to the
carbonization or breaking of the insulation around
a stationary electrode, or to the sticking of a movable
electrode in contact with a stationary. Operating
the igniters by hand will show the presence
of this last named condition, and inspection of the
insulation and terminals the presence of any defects.
Loss of power is frequently due to the leakage
of compression around the plate carrying the
igniter, around the stationary electrode, or through
the bearing in which the movable electrode rocks.
The side of the bearing toward the combustion
space is built like a valve, and when worn may be
ground to a seat.</p>

<p>If the engine runs well at low speed, but misses
at high speed, the fault may be located in faulty
insulation of one of the stationary electrodes, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
holds the low-pressure current developed by the
magneto at low speed, but fails to retain the higher
pressure developed when the speed is increased.
The faulty igniter may be located by running the
engine one cylinder at a time.</p>

<p>The heat developed by the spark is very great, and
provisions must be made to preserve the contact
points from undue corrosion. These points are
usually made of platinum, or of an alloy of platinum
and iridium, and must be kept clean and
smooth. The spring that draws the movable electrode
against the stationary must not be too strong
or it will bring the contacts together with sufficient
force to batter them out of shape. This spring
should be of sufficient strength to bring them together
promptly, but without undue force. The
tappet spring should be of considerable strength,
in order that the separation of the electrodes may
be quick and positive.</p>

<p>After long running the contacts will become worn
to such an extent that the spark occurs too late in the
stroke to permit the engine to develop its full power.
This may be corrected by readjustment of the tappets,
so that ignition takes place earlier. A wearing
of the outside arm of the movable electrode, or of
the tappet head, will have the same effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>Another cause of failure will be the weakness of
the spring of the movable electrode, which is so
weakened that it will not do its work at high speed.</p>


<h3>L. T. MAGNETO WITH SECONDARY COIL</h3>

<p>The advantages of a magneto as a current producer
for the low-tension system pointed the way to
its adoption for the jump spark system also, but it
was at once recognized that it would be impossible
to lead the current direct to the primary winding,
as the current from a battery is used. The reason
for this is that while the battery delivers a current
of constant value, the current obtained from a magneto
is fluctuating, its intensity depending on the
positions of the armature as it revolves, and the
speed at which it is driven. A current is induced
in the secondary winding of the coil as the magnetic
field set up by the core changes its strength,
and as has been explained, the induced current is
strongest when the greatest change in the strength
of the field occurs in the shortest possible time. The
effect of the flow of the magneto current through
the primary winding of the coil would be to magnetize
and demagnetize the core slowly, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
magneto current increased to its maximum and died
away to the minimum, and these gradual changes
in the magnetic field of the core would induce currents
in the secondary that would be too feeble to
produce ignition of the charge. When a battery is
used with a coil, the operation of the vibrator produces
rapid magnetizations and demagnetizations of
the core, but as the field set up by the core dies
away more rapidly than it is established, the greatest
current is induced by the breaking of the circuit.
In the best known method of applying a
magneto to the operation of a secondary coil, the
magnetization of the core is caused to occur with
exceeding rapidity, and the current induced in the
secondary winding as this occurs is sufficient for
ignition.</p>

<p>This is known as the Eisemann system, and is in
very general use. A diagram illustrating the
connections is shown in Fig. 9.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image285" style="max-width: 60em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image285.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.—Eisemann Ignition System.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The magneto is of the usual type, but the winding
is so proportioned that the current is of lower voltage
than is delivered by what has been described
as the low-tension type of magneto. One end of
the winding is grounded on the metal of the armature,
and the live end is carried to a contact screw.
The current flows to this screw, and from there two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>paths are presented by which it may flow back and
complete its circuit. One of these paths leads
through the primary winding of a secondary coil,
and the other through a lever that for the greater
part of the revolution of the armature touches the
contact screw. The lever is grounded on the metal
of the magneto, and when it touches the contact the
circuit that is then completed is short and of low
resistance, and the current follows it in preference
to the circuit of higher resistance through the primary
winding of the coil. The flow of current is
thus from the armature winding to the contact
screw, which is insulated from the metal of the
magneto, to the lever, and by the ground back to
the winding. Attached to the end of the armature
shaft, and so placed that it operates the lever, is a
cam with two projections, these projections being
arranged to move the lever away from the contact
screw. This arrangement is called the <b>interruptor</b>,
and by its operation it closes and opens the low-resistance
circuit by which the magneto current may
flow.</p>

<p>When the armature is horizontal, and during the
time that it is approaching the vertical, the circuit is
closed through the interruptor, but when the armature
reaches the position in which it gives its maximum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
current, the interrupted is opened by the cam,
and the current, losing its low-resistance circuit,
is required to flow through the primary winding of
the coil, for that is the only path by which it can
return to the armature winding. The sudden flow
of this current through the primary winding results
in the production of a powerful magnetic field
around the core, and this rapid growth in the
strength of its field induces a current in the secondary
winding that is sufficient for the ignition of the
charge. As the magneto current is at its maximum
twice during each revolution of the armature,
the cam is arranged to open the low-resistance circuit
at such periods that each maximum is required
to flow through the primary of the coil.</p>

<p>In applying this system to a multicylinder engine,
it is necessary to distribute the secondary current
to the different cylinders, so that a spark will
be produced in each as it is required. This is accomplished
by means of a <b>secondary distributor</b>,
consisting of a revolving conductor to which the
secondary current is led, and a stationary contact
for each cylinder arranged in a circle, to be touched
as it revolves. These stationary contacts are connected
with the spark plugs, according to the firing
order of the engine. During one revolution of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
distributor, a spark is produced in each of the cylinders,
and as two revolutions of the crank shaft are
necessary in order to have power strokes occur in
all of the cylinders, the distributor must revolve at
half the speed of the crank shaft. The magneto produces
a current that is sufficient for ignition twice
during each revolution of the armature, and therefore,
for four cylinder engines, must run at the speed
of the crank shaft. For the sake of compactness,
the distributor is built into the magneto, its shaft
being carried in bearings that support it above the
armature and under the arch of the field magnets.
It is geared to the armature so that the two revolve
in a fixed relation to each other, and in order that
the distributor may run at half the speed of the armature,
its gear has twice the number of teeth of
the gear on the armature shaft that drives it.</p>

<p>The secondary induction coil used is similar in
construction to the coils used for ignition by battery,
except that it is heavier, and has no vibrator. The
period during which the magneto is delivering its
maximum current is so brief that there would
hardly be time for a vibrator to get into action,
and even if this were not the case, the making and
breaking of the circuit by the vibrator is not necessary,
as the single change in the strength of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
magnetic field set up by the core is so abrupt that
the current induced by it is sufficient for the
purpose.</p>

<p>The strength of this secondary current is such
that it is necessary to provide a circuit for it if by
any accident or oversight the circuit through the
distributor or spark plugs is interrupted, as would
be the case should one of the secondary wires become
disconnected. This is taken care of by what
is known as the <b>safety spark gap</b>, which is a gap
provided between the secondary terminals of the
coil, or between the live end of the secondary winding
and the ground. This safety spark gap, in the
case of the coil furnished by the Eisemann company,
takes the form of two flat pieces of brass,
each in contact with one of the secondary terminals
of the coil, their pointed ends being separated by a
distance of about half an inch. When there is no
interruption of the secondary circuit, and the parts
of the secondary system do not present undue resistance
to the flow of the current, the higher resistance
of the air space between the points of the safety
spark gap prevents the current from jumping between
them, but should one of the secondary cables
become disconnected, the pressure of the current
will rise to a point that will enable it to jump the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
gap between the two points. If it were not for
this safety gap, an interruption of the secondary
circuit would make the pressure of the current
rise to such an extent that there would be great
danger of a spark passing inside of the coil, rupturing
the insulation.</p>

<p>As the magneto is received from the makers, the
parts will be in a fixed relation to each other; when
the armature is vertical, and held in that position
by the lines of force, the cam is in the act of opening
the primary interruptor, and the revolving part
of the secondary distributor has moved into contact
with one of the stationary contacts about one thirty-second
of an inch.</p>

<p>The interruptor of the magneto can be utilized
as the timer for an ignition system by battery and
coil, the secondary current being distributed to the
cylinders by the distributor. A better arrangement,
however, requires the use of two coils, and a timer
which is carried on the rear end of the distributor
shaft. The coil for the battery system is provided
with a vibrator, and connections are made in the
manner usual with a system composed of these
parts. The coil is in a case that also contains the
non-vibrator coil for the magneto system, and the
two wirings are separate and distinct with the exception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
of the secondary connection between the
coil box and the revolving parts of the distributor,
which is common to both.</p>

<p>While little change in the position of the spark
is required for this system, provisions are made
by which it may be advanced or retarded. In one
system, the interruptor is operated by a groove in
the face of the cam disk, a pin on the end of the
interruptor lever following the groove and being
moved by the irregularities. In this case, the advance
and retard of the spark is obtained by rotating
a plate carrying the interruptor in one direction
or the other, so that the lever is moved
earlier or later in the revolution of the cam. In
another type the gear driving the armature is not
attached direct to the armature shaft, but to a
sleeve surrounding the shaft, and the pulling out
of a second sleeve between the two alters the position
of the armature in relation to the driving gear,
resulting in the advancing or delaying of the moment
when the maximum current is produced.</p>


<h3>SETTING UP THE SYSTEM</h3>

<p>In setting up a system of this description, the firing
order of the engine must be ascertained, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
this may be done by watching the order in which
the exhaust valve stems move as the engine is
slowly cranked. Piston No. 1 must then be brought
to top dead center of the compression stroke, and
about one thirty-second of an inch down on the
power stroke, being stopped in this position. With
the magneto screwed into place, the covers of the
interruptor and distributor may be removed, and
the armature revolved by hand in the direction
in which it will be driven, until the interruptor
opens, the spark control being in the most retarded
position. A mark on the interruptor will come into
line with a mark on the casing at the instant that
the interruptor breaks contact. The magneto gear
should then be meshed with the gear that drives
it, and the lock nut set up.</p>

<p>The connection between the live end of the armature
winding and the interruptor is arranged by the
maker, but it is necessary to make connections between
the magneto and the coil. A terminal will
be found in the casing close to the stationary contact
screw, and this is to be connected with one of
the primary terminals of the coil, the other primary
terminal either being grounded on the engine or
the magneto, according to the construction. The
moving part of the secondary distributor may then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
be connected with the secondary terminal of the
coil. If the coil has but three terminals, two primary
and one secondary, there are no further coil
connections to be made, but if, as is sometimes the
case, there are two secondary terminals, the free
one is to be grounded on the engine.</p>

<p>An inspection of the distributor will show that
the revolving part is beginning to make contact with
one of the stationary points, and this point is to be
connected to the spark plug of the cylinder in which
the piston is at top dead center of the compression
stroke. The next distributor point in the direction
of rotation is to be connected with the spark plug
of the next cylinder to fire, the remaining distributor
points and spark plugs being connected in the
order of firing.</p>

<p>Magnetos of this type are built to run in either
clockwise or counter clockwise, and the two are not
interchangeable. The direction in which the magneto
is to be driven is indicated by an arrow stamped
on the gear casing or end plate.</p>

<p>When the system is properly installed, the motor
should start on a quarter-turn of the crank shaft,
the crank being given a quick upward jerk. If it
does not, the setting is incorrect, the connections
are improperly made, or there is too great a distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
between the points of the spark plugs. This
distance should be one sixty-fourth of an inch.</p>


<h3>CARE</h3>

<p>The bearings of the armature and secondary
shafts must be kept well lubricated, as well as the
parts of the interruptor that require it.</p>

<p>Every few weeks, depending on the use, the carbon
or steel brush bearing against the live end of
the armature shaft must be wiped off with gasoline,
and the same care must be given to the distributor
contacts and to the platinum contacts of the interruptor.</p>

<p>When the platinum contacts of the interruptor
become worn down after long use, or if for any
other reason they require readjustment, they must be
set so that the distance between them at the moment
that the cam holds them apart is not more than one
one-hundredth of an inch. This space may appear to
be very small for the work that is to be performed,
but it will be sufficient, and a greater distance will
result in sparking that will burn down the contacts.
In the Eisemann magneto, the adjustable contact is
held by two nuts, and small open end wrenches are
provided to fit. A wrench should be applied to each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
of these nuts, and the lower or lock nut loosened.
This will free the upper nut by which the adjustment
may be made, and the lock nut may then
be tightened. The contact faces of the platinums
should be kept flat and smooth, and true to each
other, so that they come together squarely. If they
are pitted after long use they may be faced off with
a dead smooth file, but this is a job that requires
great care, and must only be done under the most
favorable conditions. When completely worn down
they should be replaced with new ones.</p>


<h3>TROUBLES</h3>

<p>Should the engine show a tendency to miss, the
first suspicion, if the magneto contacts are known
to be correct, should fall on the spark plugs, and
the easiest method of testing them out is to replace
them with new ones. After considerable use, the
spark plug points will burn off, and the size of the
gap will increase to such an extent that the spark
will find less resistance in traversing the safety
spark gap than the gap in the plug.</p>

<p>In order that the ignition may be cut off for the
purpose of stopping the engine, a switch is always
provided by which the magneto may be short circuited,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
one pole of the switch being connected to the
magneto terminal, or live wire, and the other pole
grounded, as shown in Fig. 9. When this switch
is closed, the magneto current flows through it in
a closed circuit, and as it abandons its path through
the interruptor there will be no further action in
the coil, the ignition of course ceasing. This
switch is often located in the rim or arm of the steering
wheel, so arranged that pressing on a button
closes the circuit and diverts the magneto current
from the coil.</p>

<p>Any accidental short circuit of the magneto current
will produce the same effect, and in case of the
abrupt cessation of ignition, this is one of the probable
causes. A short circuit in the secondary will
usually make itself known by the snapping of the
sparks as they pass through broken insulation or
from a frayed cable end.</p>

<p>The remarks on general magneto troubles and
care already made on page <a href="#Page_254">254</a> also apply to a magneto
of this type, and the same rules regarding the
protecting of the circuit of the lines of the field
must be borne in mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>


<h3>H.-T. MAGNETO SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>A high-tension magneto differs from the types
described in that the armature has a double winding;
one, the primary winding, consisting of a few
layers of coarse wire, and the secondary winding,
placed over the primary, consisting of many layers
of very fine wire. As the armature revolves, a current
is induced in the primary winding, the circuit
of which is kept closed until the armature reaches
the position in which the induced current is at its
greatest value. An interruptor operated by a cam
then opens the primary circuit, and the sudden demagnetization
of the armature core that results induces
in the secondary winding a current of high
pressure that is quite sufficient to jump the gap in
the spark plug and to cause ignition of the mixture.
The construction of the armature is more delicate
than is the case with a low-tension magneto, for
the secondary winding must have a large number of
layers, and to permit this in the limited space, the
wire must be fine. In addition, it must be insulated
with the greatest care, for the intensity of the current
produced will enable it to seek out and to break
down any weakness that exists. There must also
be two brushes, one for the primary current and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
one for the secondary, which complicates the construction.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image298" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image298.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.—Wiring Diagram, H.-T. Magneto Interchangeable
with Secondary Coil.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>A magneto of this type is shown in diagram in
Fig. 10. In this case, the inner ends of both the
primary and secondary windings are grounded, the
live end of the primary being connected with the
insulated contact of the interruptor, and the live end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
of the secondary leading to the rotating part of a
secondary distributor. For the greater part of the
revolution of the armature, the cam on the armature
shaft permits the interruptor to maintain a closed
circuit, but as the current reaches a maximum the
cam breaks the circuit, and the flow of the primary
current ceases. During this time, the secondary
circuit has been open, the moving part of the distributor
being out of contact with the stationary
points. Under the law of induction, a current will
only be induced in a closed circuit, and there is
therefore no action in the secondary winding.
When the primary current is at its maximum and
its circuit is broken, another condition exists, for
then the secondary distributor is making contact,
the only gap being in the spark plug, but the sudden
demagnetization of the armature core as the primary
circuit is broken, and the additional effect as
the armature passes the vertical position, induces
in the secondary winding a current of great intensity
that passes to the spark plug by way of the
distributor, returning to the winding by the ground.</p>

<p>The parts of the interruptor are carried on one of
the end plates of the magneto, and the secondary
distributor revolves in bearings that support it under
the arch of the magnets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>In the diagram shown provisions are made for
a double ignition system, the operator having his
choice of ignition by high-tension magneto direct
or by battery, timer and coil. In practice, the three
switches shown operate together. When magneto
ignition is desired, the switch between the battery
and ground is opened, and the switch at the secondary
distributor thrown into contact with the point
connected with the secondary terminal of the magneto.
The third switch is thrown to make contact
between the primary terminal of the magneto and
the interruptor. If battery ignition is desired, the
switch on the magneto primary is thrown to the
point through which it is grounded, and the primary
and secondary switches of the battery circuit
closed. The upper contact points of the interruptor
are then utilized to close primary circuit of battery,
and the secondary current induced in coil is
led to distributor. This complication of switches is
necessary to prevent possibility of the battery current
flowing through the armature winding, and to
provide a short circuit for the primary of the magneto.
If the engine is running on magneto ignition,
it is stopped by throwing the primary switch to the
point by which the primary is grounded. If running
on battery, the circuit is broken in the usual way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>The current from a high-tension magneto is of
such intensity that the small points of an ordinary
spark plug would quickly be burned, and it is necessary
to provide plugs with heavy points, which
will stand the work. The distance between the
points should be about one sixty-fourth of an inch.</p>

<p>The Bosch magnetos, which are perhaps in more
general use than any other, are built on similar lines
to the magneto just described, except that the
grounded end of the secondary winding, instead of
being attached to the metal of the armature, is connected
to the live end of the primary winding, as
shown in Fig. 11. The live end of the primary is
brought out through a conducting rod passing
lengthways through one end of the armature shaft,
from which the current flows to the stationary contact
of the interruptor. While in other magnetos
the interruptor parts are stationary and operated by
a moving cam, in this type the interruptor parts revolve
with the armature, and the moving arm is
operated by two fiber wheels as it drags around the
inside of a stationary ring. By rotating the ring
and the two wheels the interruptor is caused to
operate sooner or later in its revolution, this giving
the advance and retard of the spark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image302" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image302.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.—Wiring Diagram, Two-Spark Magneto.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The other end of the armature shaft carries the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>collecting ring for the secondary current, this consisting
of a hard rubber disk around the surface of
which is a metal ring to which the live end of the
secondary winding is connected. A carbon brush
is kept pressed against this metal ring by a light
spring, and the current is thus led off to the revolving
part of a secondary distributor.</p>

<p>The interruptor keeps the primary circuit closed
until the current induced in the primary winding is
at its maximum, when the opening of this circuit
causes the rapid demagnetization of the core, and
a powerful current is induced in the secondary,
which flows to the spark plug with which the distributor
is making contact.</p>

<p>A safety spark gap is applied between the brass
strip that conducts the secondary current from the
collecting brush to the distributor, and the metal of
the magneto. The necessity for this device has already
been explained, and it is essential that a magneto
of this type should be so provided, because of
the intensity of the current.</p>


<h3>SETTING</h3>

<div class="figleft illowp40" id="image304" style="max-width: 30.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image304.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.—Timing Diagram, Two-Spark Magneto.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In setting up a system of ignition with a magneto
of this type, the firing order of the engine must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
observed, and then one of the pistons brought to the
point in the compression stroke that it will occupy
when the spark is at the
greatest advance. As has
been explained in the case
of engines equipped for
the make and break system,
this point will usually
be from one-half to three-quarters
of an inch before
top dead center, the
greater proportion of designs
placing it at one-half
an inch. The driving
gear of a Bosch magneto
is not keyed to the armature
shaft, but shaft and
gear are tapered, so that
when the nut is drawn up tight there is no possibility
of slipping. After the magneto is secured
in position its gear may be meshed with the gear
that is to drive it, but without drawing up the nut.
The armature may then be turned by hand until it
is in the vertical position, where it will be retained
by the lines of force (Fig. 12), and the gear nut
drawn up tight. If this position of the armature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
cannot be obtained by the sense of touch, it may be
exposed to sight by the removal of the bridge that
carries the safety spark gap, and of the dust cover
that protects the space between the upper sides of
the pole pieces.</p>

<p>The loosening of the three-armed frame on the
front of the magneto will permit the removal of the
covers of the interruptor and timer, and it will be
seen that the moving part of the distributor is beginning
to make contact with one of the stationary
pieces; this should be connected to the spark plug
of the cylinder that is in the firing position. The
other contacts of the distributor should then be connected
to the remaining spark plugs in the order of
firing.</p>

<p>Ignition is cut out by short-circuiting the primary
winding, and a binding post will be found on the
front of the magneto under the three-pronged frame
to which is connected the wire that leads to a switch
making a ground connection when closed.</p>


<h3>CARE</h3>

<p>The armature and distributor shafts run on ball
bearings, and these require the application of a few
drops of oil twice a month. The interruptor is designed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
to operate without oil, and there is therefore
little danger of oil working its way into the
winding.</p>

<p>The carbon brushes must be wiped off with a little
gasoline occasionally, and these are arranged in
such a manner that they are easy of access.</p>

<p>The platinum contacts of the interruptor must
be kept free from dirt and oil, and when, after long
use, they become worn and uneven, they must be
faced off by the use of a dead smooth file. The
distance between them when separated by the action
of the fiber rollers must not be more than one sixty-fourth
of an inch, and this may be adjusted by
means of the nuts. Accompanying each magneto
is a small open end wrench for this purpose, to
which is pivoted a leaf of steel that is to be used as
a gauge for this distance.</p>

<p>This same measurement applies to the spark
plugs, the points of which must provide a gap of not
more than one sixty-fourth of an inch.</p>


<h3>TROUBLES</h3>

<p>If there is an abrupt failure of ignition, it is probable
that the primary is short-circuited, and this can
only occur on the wire that leads to the short-circuiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
switch, for the other parts of the primary
circuit are inclosed and protected against injury.</p>

<p>In case of the missing of one cylinder only, the
trouble will usually be found in the plug, which may
be short-circuited by a carbon deposit, or because
the intense heat of the spark has fused the metal,
resulting in the formation of a globule of metal
between the spark points. Too great a distance between
the points, more than one sixty-fourth of an
inch, will prevent the passing of the spark, which
will then be seen in the safety spark gap.</p>

<p>A miss in different cylinders may be due to defective
insulation of the wires, but if these are in
good condition the fault may be looked for in the
magneto. The place where trouble is usually experienced
is in the interruptor, which may become dirty,
or the contacts may be worn down or loosened from
the vibration. Fouled contacts in the distributor
may also lead to a miss-fire, and this will be corrected
by wiping the parts with gasoline. If all
of these parts have been examined and found correct,
it is inadvisable to examine further into the
magneto, for inexperienced handling will be likely
to injure the delicate parts. It is better to place
it in the hands of a man whose shop is equipped for
the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>


<h3>FOUR-SPARK MAGNETO</h3>

<p>All of the magnetos described have been of the
type in which the armature revolves, and two ignitions
are secured per revolution. These are
known as two-spark magnetos, or crank-shaft speed
magnetos, from the fact that for four cylinder engines
the magneto runs at the speed of the crank
shaft. This is in distinction to the Bosch four-spark,
or cam-shaft speed, magnetos, in which the
armature as well as the field is stationary. This
magneto for its simplicity, freedom from trouble,
and workmanship, has few equals for the high-tension
ignition of an internal combustion engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image309" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image309.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.—Diagrams showing Position of Shield Revolving about Armature.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The armature in this magneto is of the usual type,
and is stationary, with the armature neck in a vertical
position. Around the armature, and between
it and the pole pieces, revolves a soft iron shield
in two sections, these being the length of the armature
and the same width as the heads. As it revolves,
it forms bridges between the pole pieces
and the core of the armature, the lines of force
flowing through it as well as through the armature.
The diagrams of Fig. 13 show the positions of the
shield as it revolves about the armature. In the
first position, one segment of the shield forms a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>bridge between the pole piece and the upper armature
head, while the other segment is bridging the
space between the lower head and the other pole
piece. When in this position, the lines of force flow
through the neck of the armature and magnetize it
so that it sets up its own field. When the shield revolves
so that it covers the heads, the lines of force
abandon the neck and flow between the pole pieces
by the segments, the field established by the neck
dying out. In the third position, the lines of force
again flow through the neck, while in the fourth
position, with the shield completing a half revolution,
the lines of force again pass directly across.
In this half revolution there are therefore two periods
when a magnetic field forms around the armature
neck and dies out, which will result in the induction
of two currents in the winding of the armature.
If the revolution is continued it will be seen
that the same conditions are repeated, the positions
of the two segments of the shield being reversed,
and that one revolution of the shield about the
armature will produce four waves of current in the
winding. The magneto may therefore be driven at
cam shaft speed for a four cylinder engine, and in
addition has the advantage of the wire windings
being stationary. The action of the magneto is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
the same as that of the two-spark type already described,
but the construction is simplified because
the slow speed of the shield will permit the secondary
distributor to be attached directly to the armature
shaft, the secondary shaft being done away
with.</p>

<p>A diagram of the wiring is shown in Fig. 14.
The primary wiring is grounded, and the live end
brought out to the stationary contact point of the
interruptor. The moving part of the interruptor
is pivoted in the center, and the lower end, a polished
steel knob, bears against the face of a disk
that has four ribs running from center to edge.
When the knob is on the space between two of the
ribs, the interruptor closes the circuit, but as the
disk revolves and a rib touches the knob, the arm
moves on its pivot, and the circuit is broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image312" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image312.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.—Wiring Diagram, Four-Spark Magneto.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The grounded end of the secondary winding is
attached to the live end of the primary winding,
and its other terminal passes to a contact point carried
on a hard rubber disk placed on the revolving
shaft immediately in front of the interruptor. The
diagram shows a face view of this distributor, as
well as a side view. A ring-shaped plate is set on
one side of this disk, and is in connection with a
contact piece carried on the edge of the disk. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>carbon brush to which the live end of the secondary
winding is attached is kept pressed against the ring-shaped
plate, and the secondary current is thus led
to the contact piece on the edge of the disk. As the
disk revolves with the shaft of the shield the contact
piece comes into successive contact with four
carbon brushes, which are connected to the spark
plugs.</p>

<p>When the shield is in such a position that the
lines of force flow through the neck of the armature,
the interruptor is closed, but when the intensity
of the current increases to the maximum the
interruptor opens, breaking the primary circuit, and
producing a rapid demagnetization of the armature
core. This dying out of the field induces a powerful
current in the secondary winding, which is led
by the distributor to one of the spark plugs, where
it jumps the gap and returns to the winding by the
ground connection.</p>


<h3>SETTING</h3>

<p>In setting the magneto the firing order of the engine
is noted, as has been explained, and the magneto
secured in position with its gear in mesh, but
loose on the shaft. The cover over the space between
the pole pieces will be found to be in the form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
of a shallow aluminum box, which is held in position
by a single screw with a large head, and when
this is removed the stationary armature and revolving
shield will be exposed to view. One of the
pistons must then be brought into the position it
will take with a fully advanced spark, and the shield
then revolved until it is in the position shown in
Fig. 15. The nut securing the gear to the shaft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
may then be drawn up tight. It will be noticed that
one of the segments of the shield has a deep notch
at each edge. Remembering the direction in which
the shield will be driven, the notch at the rear edge
of the shield will indicate the position of the contact
piece of the distributor which will then be coming
into contact with the carbon brush of one of the
stationary distributor contacts. The spark plug of
the cylinder that is in the firing position should be
connected to the brush that the notch indicates as
making contact, and the remaining spark plugs and
brushes connected according to the firing order.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image314" style="max-width: 42.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image314.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.—Timing Diagram, Four-Spark Magneto.</span></p></div>
</div>

<h3>CARE</h3>

<p>The proper operation of the magneto requires the
free and perfect action of the interruptor, and this
may be observed by means of a brass slide that
operates on the arm or the spark control lever.
When this slide is raised, the action of the interruptor
may be watched. Like the two-spark Bosch
magneto, the distance between these points when
the disk separates them should be one sixty-fourth
of an inch, and contact should be made and broken
without undue sparking. The condenser that will
be found in the shallow aluminum box covering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
space between the pole pieces prevents sparking at
the interrupter, and is thrown into circuit automatically
when it is placed in position.</p>

<p>The four-spark magneto is provided with a safety
spark gap, and when the points of one of the spark
plugs are separated too far, or when there is any
interruption of the secondary circuit, a spark will
show there. Sparks should not be permitted to
pass in the safety gap for any considerable period,
as damage will be done, and when they indicate by
their presence that something is wrong, the trouble
should be located and repaired without delay.</p>

<p>The regulation and care of the four-spark magneto
is the same as has been described for the two-spark
machine.</p>


<h3>DUAL IGNITION SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>It has been the custom to equip jump-spark engines
with two complete systems of ignition, one
operated by a magneto and the other by coil and battery.
Each system has its own spark plugs, timing
device, wiring, etc., the two being connected only at
the switch. Many of these duplicate parts have
been eliminated by the introduction of <b>dual ignition</b>
systems, and the mechanism is correspondingly simplified.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
The Bosch dual system is a good example
of the principles involved, and a diagram of the connections
is shown on Fig. 16. The magneto used is
of the usual two-spark type, except that the secondary
current, instead of being led from the collecting
ring direct to the distributer, is taken to the
switch that is located in the coil box on the dash.
In addition to the regulation interrupter illustrated
on Fig. 11, the magneto is provided with a second
interrupter or circuit breaker that controls the flow
of the battery current, and takes the place of a
timer. While the magneto interrupter revolves
with the armature, and is operated by stationary
cams, the battery circuit breaker is stationary, and
is operated by a two-nose cam that revolves with
the armature shaft. The stationary and revolving
cams are so set that the interrupter and circuit
breaker break their circuits at the same instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="image318" style="max-width: 62em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image318.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.—Bosch Jump-Spark Dual System.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The coil is contained in a brass case on the dash,
and in design and construction is a duplicate of the
magneto armature. Attached to the coil is a handle
that projects through a slot in the case, by means
of which the coil may be turned partly around in
the case. The terminals of the coil windings are
attached to metal knobs located on the under side of
a fiber plate that forms the bottom of the coil, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>turning the coil by the handle moves these knobs in
and out of contact with corresponding knobs on the
bottom of the case. These knobs form the switch
that cuts off all current, or permits the engine to
be run on magneto or battery. When the switch is
in such a position that the magneto produces secondary
current, this flows from terminal 3 of the
magneto to terminal 3 of the switch; thence by the
switch connection to terminal 4 and to the secondary
distributer. When the battery is switched in, the
magneto primary is grounded, and secondary current
from the coil flows over wire 4 to the secondary
distributer.</p>

<p>By pressing a button on top of the coil case, a
vibrator is cut into the circuit to permit starting the
engine on the spark. When the engine starts the
button is released, and ignition is produced by the
single spark that results from the demagnetizing of
the core that follows the breaking of the battery
circuit by the circuit breaker. Throwing the switch
breaks the battery circuit and cuts in the magneto.</p>

<h3>INDUCTOR MAGNETOS</h3>

</div>

<p>In types of magnetos that have recently been produced,
the winding is stationary and surrounds a
moving core that is magnetized and demagnetized
during its revolution between the poles of the field
magnets. The Remy magneto is of this type, and
Fig. 17 is a diagram of the revolving core, or inductor,
with the coil surrounding it. As the inductor
revolves, the magnetism flows from one pole of the
field magnets into the wing of the inductor nearest
to it, through the central cylindrical part, and by the
second wing to the other pole, the central part of
the inductor then being magnetized. The magnetism
of this portion dies away when the wings are in
such a position that they bridge across from one
pole to the other, but reappears when the central
cylindrical part again becomes the only path by
which the magnetism may flow. The constant
changes in the magnetic strength of the central part
affect the coil, and currents are induced in it. These
currents, which are of low voltage, are led to the
primary winding of a secondary induction coil
similar to that used in the Eisemann system, the
secondary current flowing to the plugs through a distributer
located on the magneto. In the Remy system,
the interrupter does not short circuit the magneto
winding, as is the case with the Eisemann, but
the flow of current is from the magneto winding to
the grounded side of the interrupter, to the insulated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>screw, to the primary winding of the coil, and
back to the magneto. The interrupter is closed and
the current flows in this circuit while the strength
of the current is increasing, but when the current
is at a maximum the interrupter breaks the circuit,
the core of the coil loses its magnetism, and a secondary
current is induced. The current reaches a
maximum twice in each revolution.</p>

<p>In other magnetos, the form of the inductor is
such that six or more waves of current are produced
during each revolution. An inductor of this type
is shown in Fig. 18. There are six arms radiating
from the central cylindrical portion, three at each
end, and equally spaced. The coil is usually made
of flat copper ribbon instead of wire, and it surrounds
the central cylindrical part between the two
sets of arms. In the inductor shown, the magnetism
of the central part will change strength six times to
each revolution.</p>

<p>Magnetos of this type are used to replace batteries
in jump spark systems using vibrator coils.
They are driven by belt, or by friction against the
fly wheel, and are given a speed at least three times
that of the crank shaft. By this means the waves
of current follow one another at such brief intervals
that the flow is practically continuous, and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
therefore unnecessary to time the magneto to the
engine. These magnetos have no interrupters, and
the wiring consists of one wire leading to the switch
on the coil box, the usual connections between the
coil box and timer, and a wire from the second magneto
terminal to ground.</p>

</div>

<p>The flaming spark produced by the make-and-break
system has many advantages for ignition over
the jump spark produced by the high-tension system,
but these are largely offset by the mechanical
complication of cams, tappets, springs, etc. A
make-and-break system in which the igniters are
operated by magnetism has been perfected by the
Bosch company, and is giving good results. The
magneto used is of the ordinary low-tension type,
equipped with an interrupter, while all of the igniter
parts are contained in a plug that screws into
the cylinder wall like a jump-spark plug. The plug
is shown in diagram in Fig. 19. The sleeve that
screws into the cylinder supports an iron core, the
two being thoroughly insulated by blocks and washers
of heat-proof insulating material. The upper
portion of the core has a flat side, on which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>formed a projection that serves as a pivot. A hammer
bar is balanced on this pivot, its long end passing
through the plug and coming into contact with
an anvil attached to the screwed sleeve. A long
horseshoe-shaped spring holds the two in light contact,
and the hammer bar then forms the only path
by which an electric current may pass from the core
to the screwed sleeve and to the engine ground.
When the hammer bar is moved on its pivot this
connection is broken. Surrounding the core is a
coil consisting of a few layers of wire covered with
heat-proof insulation. The upper part of the plug
is incased in a light iron casing screwed to the core,
which completely incloses the core, hammer bar,
spring and coil, and in which there is no opening
that would permit the escape of compression from
the combustion chamber. One terminal of the coil
is connected to the binding post, and the other is
grounded on the iron casing. The current generated
in the magneto passes to a distributer and
thence to the binding post of the plug, as shown in
Fig. 20. It flows through the coil to the core, and
thence by the hammer bar to the engine ground and
back to the magneto. As the current establishes itself
in the coil, the core becomes magnetized, and
attracts to it the flat end of the hammer bar. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
the hammer bar moves on its pivot, its connection
with the anvil is broken, and this break in the circuit
produces a flaming spark that is in every way
identical with the spark of the ordinary mechanical
make-and-break igniter. The casing that contains
the coil may be unscrewed from the core without
disturbing the screwed sleeve, and this makes it an
easy matter to give the moving parts the inspection
and cleaning that they should receive every few
weeks. The spark occurs in the plug at the instant
that the interrupter operates, and the setting up of
the system is identical with that of the high-tension
magneto systems.</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Henry C. Rowland</span>, author of “In the
Shadow,” etc. Illustrated by upward of fifty
sketches. 12mo. Decorated cloth, gilt top, $2.00 net.</p>

<p>This is a delightful narrative of an absolutely
unique trip. Mr. Rowland and his two friends had
a motor-boat constructed in London for a seven-thousand-mile
inland voyage which should circle
Europe by way of the Seine, the Rhine, the Danube,
and the Black Sea. The struggles with the motor,
which develops a degree of perversity almost human,
the innumerable humorous and exciting incidents,
and the final terrific adventure which ends the narrative
with a shipwreck in the Black Sea, make it the
most novel and entertaining book of travel of recent
years. The talented author is well known through
half a dozen books and many magazine stories. The
style of the volume is very attractive. Some fifty
sketches are sprinkled through the text.</p>

<p class="fs80">This is a volume of actual letters which Mrs. Moses,
the wife of Professor Moses, wrote from the Philippines to
her relatives here in the United States. Professor Moses,
who is connected with the University of California, was one
of the five members of the first commission, of which Secretary
Taft was the head, sent out by the U. S. Government
to organize the government of the Philippine Islands. The
members of this commission were practically the first
important Americans to go to the Philippines in a peaceful
and a civil capacity. Mrs. Moses, therefore, saw the social,
political, and home life in Manila as well as in the provinces
and the different islands before American civilization had
entered there to any extent. Her letters, while descriptive,
have a very definite connection one with the other. They
describe the arrival at the Philippines, the beginning of life
there, housekeeping, the seemingly strange methods of daily
life, servant problems, and so on, in Manila. Nothing like
these letters has appeared in regard to the Philippine
Islands at any time. It should be borne in mind, furthermore,
that these letters are not in any way technical or
having to do with the organization of the Philippine government.
They are, as the title suggests, quite “unofficial”
letters of a lady who, because of her connection with official
circles, saw many things which an ordinary traveler
never could see.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
